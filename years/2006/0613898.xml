<AbstractNarration>Researchers from three U.S. museums and two U.S. universities, plus a &lt;br/&gt;worldwide group of over 20 colleagues, will collaborate to conduct a global &lt;br/&gt;survey and inventory of the dwarf hunting spiders. These animals are very &lt;br/&gt;poorly known; preliminary data indicate that the 459 currently described &lt;br/&gt;species represent only about 20% of the actual diversity of the group. The &lt;br/&gt;team will assemble and sort the specimens available in collections and &lt;br/&gt;acquire new material through 12 expeditions that will concentrate on &lt;br/&gt;securing better samples of forest floor and canopy-dwelling species. Team &lt;br/&gt;members will build Internet-accessible databases of the species, all specimen locality &lt;br/&gt;data, and images; a new application will allow team members to enter descriptive &lt;br/&gt;data into a multi-user database, in a highly structured format that will &lt;br/&gt;allow direct use of that information in formal descriptions for &lt;br/&gt;publication, on species web pages, in phylogenetic analyses, and in &lt;br/&gt;interactive keys. Automated identification systems, using artificial &lt;br/&gt;neural networks, will be developed, and the accuracy of those systems will &lt;br/&gt;be compared with that achieved by workers, ranging from total beginners to &lt;br/&gt;knowledgeable specialists, using interactive keys to the same species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other impacts of the project include training several high &lt;br/&gt;school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students (with emphasis &lt;br/&gt;on recruiting members of groups currently underrepresented in the science &lt;br/&gt;workforce). Project outreach plans include a major traveling museum &lt;br/&gt;exhibition designed to focus public attention on the importance and &lt;br/&gt;excitement of biodiversity discovery and preservation. Extensive &lt;br/&gt;public-aimed web materials will be developed that will be useful for &lt;br/&gt;pre-college level teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spiders represent one of the most species rich groups of animals on the planet.  Ancient, widespread, diverse yet poorly known, spiders are a model system that may provide insights into the history, distribution, and sustainability of EarthÆs ecosystems.  At the University of California Berkeley, we have been working with other team members, in particular those at the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) to investigate the evolution and diversity of goblin spiders (Dysderoidea, including Oonopidae, Orsolobidae and Trogloraptoridae) through the goblin spider Planetary Biodiversity Inventory (PBI).  With students, postdoctoral researchers, technicians and other investigators, over the last 5 years we have discovered more than 100 species of goblin spiders (Oonopidae) from Madagascar, where previously none were known. This was a particular focus of Natalia Chousou-Polydouri,  a graduate student at UC Berkeley. Knowledge of these geographically narrowly distributed animals offers useful information for Malagasy conservation planners and contributes to the sustainability of this islandÆs unique animals and plants.  Giant goblin spiders, Orsolobidae, occur in the southern continents, on fragments of the former supercontinent Gondwana.  Knowledge of the evolution and distribution of giant goblin spiders tests competing hypotheses on the antiquity and persistence of the animals and plants scattered across the former Gondwana.  Have they persisted here through times of dramatic global change, or have they recently dispersed across wide ocean barriers?  Our evolutionary tree for Giant goblin spiders refutes predictions that the entire terrestrial biota of New Zealand was eliminated by oceanic inundation during the Oligocene, and instead shows that these spiders, and by implication at least some other animals and plants, have survived on New Zealand since the Mesozoic, for more than 70 million years. The goblin spider PBI offered wide opportunities for collaboration between students at UC Berkeley and researchers at the California Academy of Sciences.  A total of two PhD students, two MSc, two undergraduate and one from a local high school, two postdoctoral researchers, and three scientific technicians were trained through this project.  In addition to several publications in scientific journals, the main findings of the project are available at http://research.amnh.org/oonopidae.
