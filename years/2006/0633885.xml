<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for the design, development, and implemention of a component of an Arctic Ocean Observing System in the Switchyard region of the Arctic Ocean (north of Greenland and Nares Strait) that will serve the scientific studies developed for the IPY (International Polar Year), SEARCH (Study of Environmental ARctic Change), and related programs. The defining elements of the System are: (1) a multi-platform design, (2) combination of proven technology with adaptation of innovative, highly promising, new tools for operation under sea ice cover that are considered to be future backbones of a quasi-permanent, pan-Arctic Ocean System, (3) a modular approach that allows expansion of the system to a pan-Arctic scale, and (4) ongoing refinement of the design through evaluation of combined data and modeling results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project will continue and expand two aircraft-based sections between Alert and the North Pole for long-term observation of hydrographic properties and a set of tracers aimed at resolving relative age structure (CFC's, tritium/3He) and freshwater components (18O and Ba) in the upper water column, utilizing the Arctic CTD/rosette system. This modular system is deployed through a 12" hole drilled through the sea ice and traces temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, while at the same time allowing the collection of up to 12 water samples. The study also will continue one helicopter section across the shelf slope just west of Nares Strait to capture the structure and transport of the water masses coming around the Canadian Basin on their way to Nares and Fram Straits. To complete the quantitative assessment of the transport of the water masses from the Canadian Basin towards Nares Strait and Fram Strait, a set of 7 new, low-cost, lightweight moorings will be deployed across the shelf just west of Nares Strait to separate the individual transports through these straits. Finally, the planned in situ observations will be augmented by satellite-derived observations of the sea ice motion and mass budget. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Switchyard project samples the marine environment in the Lincoln Sea (just north of northern Ellesmere Island, Canada and Greenland) north to the Pole.  We call this the "Switchyard" region because like a train switching yard, different water masses and sea ice types converge into this region and are sent on their way, with some recirculating back into the Arctic OceanÆs Beaufort Gyre and the rest into the North Atlantic Ocean on different "tracks" to the west of Greenland via Nares Strait and to the east of Greenland via Fram Strait.  This is the water that influences the downstream deep water formation and thus global ocean circulation, and so it is crucial to document interannual changes in this region to achieve both understanding and a predictive capability.  The project consists mainly of ocean observations taken each springtime via aircraft based at the Canadian Forces Station "Alert" on the north coast of Ellesmere island.  Each day (weather permitting), our aircraft take off from Alert and land on the floating sea ice cover.  A hole is drilled through the ice and instruments are lowered into the ocean to measure and sample ocean properties such as temperature, salinity, and a variety of dissolved materials such as oxygen and nutrient particles.  Some observations are also taken by flying over an open water area and deploying expendable probes which radio back their data to the aircraft.  Also, we track changes over the year by deploying sensors moored to the ocean bottom near Alert.   Our data so far confirm a study we performed in the early 2000Æs that used old, very sparse data.  In that study, we speculated that the characteristics of waters entering the Lincoln Sea would be strongly influenced by the mode of atmospheric circulation present in that year.  That is, in some years the wind guides arctic waters from near Alaska to the Lincoln Sea, while in other years the source water region is instead near central/eastern Siberia.  Recent and ongoing scientific studies using our Switchyard data support this idea.  Further, new insight has come concerning the detailed water circulation in the region and how this affects water characteristics flowing downstream southward into the North  Atlantic Ocean.  In fact very recent Switchyard results indicate that exciting new changes are starting to occur in the last couple of years, which motivates us to continue the program into the future.
