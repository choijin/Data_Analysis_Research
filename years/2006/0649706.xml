<AbstractNarration>This project will examine how energetic particle precipitation affects the electrical conductivity and fields in the upper and middle atmosphere.  It will examine how solar energetic protons access the middle atmosphere and will utilize the gamma rays emitted by the incoming protons to determine the energy spectrum of the incoming particles.  It will also investigate the mechanisms which accelerate, transport, and precipitate relativistic electrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will analyze data from two balloon data sets that contain multiple episodes of energetic particle precipitation.  Models will be constructed to describe the effects these energetic particles produce in the upper and middle atmosphere.  Model results will be compared with measured middle atmosphere radiation, conductivity, and electric fields.  To determine the mechanisms which accelerate, transport and precipitate relativistic electrons the balloon observations will be combined with ground and spacecraft observations to test wave-particle interaction theories for precipitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from the project will improve our ability to predict energetic precipitation events that can affect a variety of satellites and can alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere.  The project is a collaborative one involving faculty and students at Dartmouth College, the University of Washington and the University of Houston.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project consisted of analysis of data taken by six high altitude stratospheric research MINIature Spectrometer (MINIS) balloon payloads that were flown during January, 2005. Four balloons were launched from SANAE on the coast of Antarctica, and two were launched from Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. The balloons floated at an altitude of 32 km (20 mi.). The southern flights lasted between 1 and 12 days. As many as three payloads were aloft at once. Owing to high winds, the northern flights only lasted ~ 1 day. The southern balloons carried instruments to measure electric and magnetic fields, electrical conductivity of the air, and both the counting rate and energy spectrum of X-rays.   The X-radiation is produced by interaction of precipitating energetic electrons with the top of the neutral atmosphere at ~105 km altitude.  We studied the sources, energization and loss mechanisms of energetic electrons that are trapped in the EarthÆs Van Allen radiation belts and magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is the region of the EarthÆs  atmosphere that is dominated by the EarthÆs magnetic field and filled with ionized gas and energetic charged particles rather than neutral gas (i.e. air). It extends from ~300 km to ~65,000 km altitude on the dayside of the earth and to at least 1.5 million km altitude on the nightside of the earth. The X-ray measurements on the balloon payloads determined local loss rates of the trapped electron population. The electric and magnetic field measurements observed the radio frequency electromagnetic waves that energize and precipitate the energetic electrons.  The work done by the University of Houston concentrated on detailed analyses of the electric and magnetic field measurements specifically: analysis of the waves and fluctuations in the electric field, analysis of the sun sensor data in order to determine the balloon orientation with sufficient precision to enable analysis of the magnetic component of the waves, study of the electrical conductivity variations produced by a solar flare, and a correlation analysis of the relation between electric field fluctuations and periodic variations in the X-ray counting rate.  On January 20, 2005 there was an energetic solar flare at 0636 Greenwich Time (UT) with an accompanied halo coronal mass ejection (CME) leaving the solar surface in the direction of the Earth. The flare produced a solar energetic particle (SEP) event that caused the largest ground level solar cosmic ray event since 1956.  One MINIS payload was aloft over Antarctica throughout the SEP event. The conductivity increased by nearly a factor of 20 above ambient with the SEP event onset and returned to within a factor of two above normal levels by the end of the day.  Results from an atmosphere-ionosphere conductivity model that includes ionization from energetic particle precipitation and rigidity cutoffs suggest that proton-induced ionization was responsible for the observed conductivity increase at the balloon.  Model results for this event were extended to higher and lower altitudes (20 -150 km).  These results show a maximum conductivity increase near 60 km of more than 600-fold directly after SEP event onset.      The resultant interplanetary shock impacted Earth ~36 hours later.  Near Earth, two impulses with a staircase structure in density and pressure were observed by the ACE spacecraft.  During this period, three MINIS balloons were aloft; one in the north and two in the south.  Mega-electron Volt (MeV) relativistic electron precipitation (REP) observed by all three balloons is coincident (&lt;3 minutes) with the impulse arrivals and appears to be a result of magnetospheric compression observed by both the GOES 10 and 12 spacecraft.  Balloon electric field data from the south show no signs of the impulse electric field directly reaching the ionosphere.  Enhancement of the balloon-observed convection electric field by as much as 40 mV/m over less than 20 minutes during this time period is...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
