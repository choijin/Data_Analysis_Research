<AbstractNarration>The Computing Research Association's Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W) will design, implement and evaluate a virtual research mentoring "town hall" model for large-scale mentoring of undergraduate women majors in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) towards research and graduate school.  Women have been earning only 18% of the Bachelor's degrees in CSE from 2008-2012.  These trends significantly limit the number of CSE women advancing into research and teaching careers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage students in interactive meetings with distinguished female CSE researchers and students at virtually connected sites where local groups of women students are gathered.  Distinguished researchers will present mini-lectures on their research and its impact, followed by an interactive question-and-answer town hall with mentoring related to research, graduate school, and topics suggested by students.  This project will gather evidence to determine the efficacy of using virtual meetings to scale opportunities for access to role models, awareness of the research community, and mentoring to increase retention of undergraduate women in CSE.  If effective, virtual "town hall" meetings have the potential to help to broaden participation in undergraduate research in CSE, will improve preparation for successful graduate school admissions and transitions, and will expand the local networks in computing communities across the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The mission of the Computing Research Association’s Committee on Widening Participation in Computing Research (CRA-WP) is to widen the participation and improve the access, opportunities, and positive experiences of individuals from groups underrepresented in computing research and education. CRA-WP programs serve this overarching goal at all career stages; in addition, CRA-WP, through the formation of the CRA Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP), has developed a methodology for thoroughly evaluating the success of its programs by comparing a nationwide sample of students, researchers, and faculty (non-participants) to program participants. Undergraduate: The Virtual Undergraduate Town Hall (VUTH) series established under this project included the design, implementation, and evaluation of a virtual research mentoring model for large-scale mentoring of women pursuing undergraduate majors in CSE towards research and graduate school. The project aims to significantly scale opportunities for access to role models, awareness of the research community, and mentoring to increase retention of undergraduate women in CSE, encourage strong graduate applications, and aid transition into graduate school. An essential outcome of this project is a method for comparative evaluation for the VUTH series to determine program effectiveness and improve program design.  The Data Buddies project, designed by CRA-WP and now conducted by CERP, collects and reports survey data from computer science and computer engineering departments to examine patterns of entry, experience, and progress among students and faculty.   Cumulatively, this project enabled CRA-WP to provide essential career skills, advice, and technical insight with at least 468 participants (number of participants is underreported as many "participants" were registered as an ACM-W chapter attending as a group) undergraduate students from approximately 130 institutions across the United States and Canada. CERP’s analysis assessing the impact of the Virtual Undergraduate Town Hall series found that the majority of attendees reported VUTH (i) inspired them to pursue undergraduate research and (ii)increased their sense of belonging in the computing community. Additionally, comparative analysis found that, compared to non-participants, VUTH participants were more likely to indicate they intended to pursue a Ph.D. for their highest degree.
