<AbstractNarration>Year 2015 is designated as the "International Year of Light" by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This event will educate the community on the advances, applications, and impact of light-related technologies. The event is organized by an ad-hoc committee with representatives of all major Engineering Societies and supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The event will take place in Washington, D.C. on Saturday September 12, 2015 and includes an educational event for K-12 children and a technical session. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optics and photonics is one of the most active and fast developing fields in engineering and science. Technological advances in optics and photonics have significantly advanced a broad range of areas from communication, medicine, aerospace to advanced manufacturing. The U.S. has invested significantly in optics and photonics research and applications, with leading teams conducting pioneering work across the spectrum. As technological breakthroughs continue to be achieved and new topics of optics and photonics, such as silicon photonics, plasmonics, new lasers and 2D materials, continue to emerge, the importance of research in optics and photonics and its potential societal impact should be disseminated. Hands-on demonstrations will be provided to inspire children at the Museum of American Indian during the day. The evening event will include prominent researchers in the field of optics followed by discussions and networking.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The national IYL 2015 effort in the United States was led by a group of scientific organizations. Each partner society organized and funded independent events and participated in a collaborative event in Washington, DC, with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF).   On 12 September, two events were held in the nationÆs capital, Washington, DC, that drew 1,000 participants. These events were organized by the national partner societies and funded by the National Science Foundation. The Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian hosted "the Wonders of Light: Family Science Fun," a daytime educational event featuring demonstrations on light science for school-age children and parents. Hands-on activities at the event included, among the 17 displays, an LED-light Radiance Orb provided by Light at Play Inc. that changed color with music or motion, an interactive video game that used sensors, and a green screen science reporter experience.

The Light Beyond the Bulb exhibition, curated by the Chandra X-ray Center/Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory program, was used extensively in the United States as a tool for informing the general public about IYL 2015 at over 60 documented events.  The exhibit was staged both for the daytime Family Science Fun event, and the evening event, featuring the Nobel Laureates and talks highlighting innovation in the United States.  The exhibit showcased professionally curated images with descriptive captions covering variety of light-based topics from microbiology to astronomy and creating connections with physics, optics, photonics, atmospheric and earth sciences and astrophysics.   With the help of the National Science Foundation, the public, including children and adults, were educated about the nature and wonder of light and its impact on the world in terms of everyday impact on our lives.
