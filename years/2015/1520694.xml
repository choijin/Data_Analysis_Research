<AbstractNarration>Recordings of distant earthquakes will be used in this project to infer the velocity at which the waves traveled beneath the Earth's surface. In turn, we use this information to understand the Earth's structure and, in particular, how subduction (the descent of an old tectonic plate into the Earth's mantle) produces volcanism and affects surface topography. When conducting this type of study, it is currently common to assume that the speed at which the waves travel is independent of their direction. In reality, seismic waves travel at different speeds depending on what their direction is relative to the orientation of minerals in the mantle. This phenomenon is known as anisotropy, and when not taken into account, it can bias the image of the subsurface in ways that can compromise the understanding of the subduction processes. In this project, seismologists will investigate ways to reduce this problem by incorporating physically-based estimates of the distribution of anisotropy into the imaging procedures. In this way, more accurate images of the subsurface will be determined advancing the understanding of how subduction affects the surface, including the distribution of volcanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will combine travel-time tomography, SKS splitting observations and geodynamic flow modeling to produce self-consistent models of mantle structure (isotropic and anisotropic) in the vicinity of two subduction zones. The new approach will allow us to fully integrate mantle anisotropy into teleseismic tomography of subduction zones. By incorporating estimates of the anisotropy field into travel-time tomography the scientitists will significantly reduce major artifacts stemming from the isotropic assumption and obtain a physically-based model for the strain in the mantle wedge and beneath the subducting plate. The improved imaging will allow to better recover the mantle physical state (temperature, composition and melt fraction). This methodology will be applied to existing data from the western Mediterranean and Cascadia subduction zones.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Most people don't associate the Pacific Northwest with earthquakes, but they should. It's home to the Cascadia megathrust fault that runs 600 miles from Northern California up to Vancouver Island in Canada, spanning several major metropolitan areas including Seattle and Portland, Oregon. Geophysicists have known for over a decade that not all portions of the Cascadia megathrust fault behave the same. The northern and southern sections are much more seismically active than the central section, with frequent small earthquakes and ground deformations that residents don't often notice. But why do these variations exist and what gives rise to them?</p> <p>Our research tries to answer these questions by constructing images of what's happening deep within the Earth, more than 100 kilometers below the fault. Using a novel data set collected by an amphibious array and processing these data with advanced seismic imaging methods, we have identified regions that are rising up beneath these active sections which we think are leading to the observable differences along the Cascadia fault. To develop these images, we must properly account for known variations in onshore and offshore structure and we must understand the effects of mineral alignment, or seismic anisotropy, on the resulting images.&nbsp;</p> <p>Physicians use electromagnetic waves to "see" internal structures like bones without needing to open up a human patient to view them directly. Geologists image the Earth in much the same way. Instead of X-rays, we use seismic energy radiating out from distant magnitude 6.0-plus earthquakes to help us "see" features we physically just can't get to. This energy travels like sound waves through the structures of the Earth. When rock is hotter or partially molten by even a tiny amount, seismic waves slow down. By measuring the arrival times of seismic waves, we create 3D images showing how fast or slow the seismic waves travel through specific parts of the Earth.</p> <p>To see these signals, we need records from seismic monitoring stations. More sensors provide better resolution and a clearer image, but gathering more data can be problematic when half the area you're interested in is underwater. To address this challenge, we were part of a team of scientists that deployed hundreds of seismometers on the ocean floor off the western U.S. over the span of four years, starting in 2011. This experiment, the Cascadia Initiative, was the first ever to cover an entire tectonic plate with instruments at a spacing of roughly 50 kilometers. Amphibious array data, however, presents new challenges for seismic imaging and much of our research addressed how to tackle these issues.&nbsp;</p> <p>What we found are two anomalous regions beneath the fault where seismic waves travel slower than expected. These anomalies are large, about 150 kilometers in diameter, and show up beneath the northern and southern sections of the fault. &nbsp;That?s where researchers have already observed increased seismic activity. Interestingly, the anomalies are not present beneath the central part of the fault, under Oregon, where we see a decrease in activity.</p> <p>Regions where seismic waves moved more slowly, on average, are redder, while the areas where they moved more quickly are bluer (see Figures). The slower anomalous areas 150 km beneath the Earth?s surface corresponded to where the colliding plates are more locked and where tremor is more common.&nbsp;</p> <p>These physical changes cause the anomalous regions to be more buoyant since melted hot rock is less dense than solid cooler rock. It's this buoyancy &nbsp;that we believe is affecting how the fault above behaves. The hot, partially molten region pushes upwards on what's above, similar to how a helium balloon might rise up against a sheet draped over it. We believe this increases the forces between the two plates, causing them to be more strongly coupled and thus more fully locked.</p> <p>Our results provide new insights into how this subduction zone, and possibly others, behaves over geologic time frames of millions of years. Unfortunately &nbsp;our results can't predict when the next large Cascadia megathrust earthquake will occur. This will require more research and dense active monitoring of the subduction zone, both onshore and offshore, using seismic and GPS-like stations to capture short-term phenomena.</p> <p>Our work does suggest that a large event is more likely to start in either the northern or southern sections of the fault, where the plates are more fully locked, and gives a possible reason for why that may be the case.&nbsp;</p> <p>It remains important for the public and policymakers to stay informed about the potential risk involved in cohabiting with a subduction zone fault and to support programs such as Earthquake Early Warning that seek to expand our monitoring capabilities and mitigate loss in the event of a large rupture.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Douglas&nbsp;R&nbsp;Toomey</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1520694/1520694_10372584_1549303686828_Figure1_new-01--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1520694/1520694_10372584_1549303686828_Figure1_new-01--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1:  Tectonic setting and seismic instruments"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1520694/1520694_10372584_1549303686828_Figure1_new-01--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1:  Tectonic setting and seismic instruments"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Left: Tectonic features of the Cascadia subduction zone and the Juan de Fuca plate system.
