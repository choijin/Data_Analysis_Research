<AbstractNarration>This research project aims to develop new tools in probability theory that will enhance understanding of interacting particle systems and random networks. The motivating problems touch fundamental questions such as the effect of initial conditions (e.g., ordered or disordered, random or fixed) in Markov chains on their time of convergence to equilibrium, and structure formation (surface shape, subgraphs in networks, etc.) versus disorder under various conditions. Many of the questions under study remain open, despite extensive studies offering detailed heuristics and corroborating experiments; the goal of this project is to make progress on these via new methods of analysis, which are expected to find further applications in probability theory as well as in other areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first research project focuses on the interplay between a spin system, such as the Ising or Potts model, and a natural Markov chain modelling its evolution, for example Metropolis or heat-bath Glauber dynamics. The phase transition that both the dynamical and static models undergo has received much attention, yet various basic problems have so far been out of reach of rigorous analysis in all three (high, low, and critical) temperature regimes.  This project studies several such problems, as well as newer ones  suggested by recent advances, including understanding the effect of the initial configurations (random or deterministic, balanced or alternating, etc.) on the mixing time at high temperature and establishing a power-law for mixing at criticality in dimension 3 and higher.  A second research direction focuses on random surface models, as well as their evolution, with ramifications for the Ising model and the roughening transition in crystals. The final research topic addresses random walks on the Erdos-Renyi random graph: the project aims to study the effect of the initial state on the mixing time of random walks, and in different regimes to establish typical structural properties, such as robustness of its features to noise, and atypical ones, such as whether the system organizes to asymmetric structures when conditioned on an atypical event (large deviations).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    One of the main focuses of this research project was to study the dynamical phase transition in the two-dimensional q-state Potts model, a classical  spin system introduced by Domb in 1951, whose particles are positioned on the vertices of a square torus. Just like its 2-state special case, the Ising model (that was introduced by Lenz in 1920), the Potts model demonstrates how local interactions---each particle evolves via a local rule that only examines the state of its nearest neighbors---can lead to global phenomena. The model is associated with an external parameter, the temperature, and undergoes a phase transition where (a) above a critical temperature Tc (that depends on q), the local interactions (whereby the model promotes agreement between the states of nearest neighbors) do not lead to long-range correlations, and instead the correlations decay exponentially fast in the distance between sites; and (b) below the critical temperature, the correlations between sites are present (bounded from below) independently of the distance between sites. This ``static'' phase transition has a dynamical counterpart, where (a) above Tc the evolution of the system (as per the Glauber dynamics, a natural rule which each particle periodically (according to independent random clock rings) updates its state by examining its nearest-neighbors) is rapid, meaning there is exponentially fast (in time) convergence to equilibrium; and (b) below Tc it is exponentially slow in the side-length of the grid. Both the static and the dynamical behaviors at the critical point Tc remain to a large part mysterious, and depend on q, the number of states in the model. Our project examined the dynamical behavior at the critical point Tc on the square grid, where the longstanding conjectures from simulations by physicists give the following picture: at q=2,3,4 the convergence to equilibrium should be polynomially fast (in the number of particles)---a slowdown compared to high temperatures but still substantially faster than the low temperature behavior. Moreover, the exponent of this polynomial should be universal---known as the ``dynamical critical exponent,'' it is expected to depend only on q, and be independent of the type of 2D lattice on which the particles are positioned (e.g., positioning them on a triangular lattice, rather than the square grid, would correspond to a different value of Tc, but feature the same dynamical critical exponent). At q=5 and larger, however, the slowdown should be to an exponentially slow convergence to equilibrium, as the static Potts model undergoes a first-order phase transition for these values of q. This picture was confirmed for q=2 (the Ising model), and one of the main objectives in the research project was to establish it rigorously for the Potts model: namely, to show sub-exponential upper bounds on the convergence to equilibrium for q=3 and q=4 states (no such bounds were known) and show  exponential lower bounds for q=5 and larger (such bounds were only known for very large values of q).      In a series of papers with Reza Gheissari, as part of his Ph.D. thesis at NYU, we settled these problems, obtaining a polynomial upper bound for the critical 3-state Potts model and a quasi-polynomial upper bound for the critical 4-state Potts model. We further showed that, when the phase transition is of first-order  (recently shown to be the case for every q larger than 4), the evolution of the critical Potts model on the square torus is exponentially slow; moreover, a faster evolution where the sites undergo a global update, known as the Swendsen--Wang dynamics, is also exponentially slow. Surprisingly, we found that, looking at the system on a square grid where the sites on the boundary of the box are free to assume every state and simply have fewer neighbors---as opposed to the case of the square torus---it turns out that the evolution of the system in the faster global update rule due to Swendsen--Wang is sub-exponential.

Major open problems that remain open for further research directions include establishing the true polynomial behavior including the existence of a universal dynamical critical exponent, and attacking the 3D Ising and Potts models, where little is known about the dynamical behavior at criticality.
