<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation to the University Corporation, Northridge provides  support for expanding and strengthening the computational facility of the W.M. Keck Computational Materials Theory Center at California State University Northridge (CSUN), a Hispanic serving institution. The cluster will enable cutting-edge materials research and education in the following three areas: (1) in strongly interacting many-body electronic systems; (2) in spin transport in multifunctional devices; and (3) in interfacial charge transfer and separation in excitonic photovoltaics. The goal is to advance fundamental understanding of exotic quantum states of matter, to unravel intricate interaction between electron charge and spin, and to expand the knowledge basis for rational design of photovoltaic materials. The research has potential to lead to faster computers, ultra-high capacity memory storage devices, and cheaper "plastic" solar cells. The cluster will also facilitate the education and training of next generation of materials scientists, including students from underrepresented groups. Computational courses will be developed where students gain hands-on experience in scientific programming and solving practical problems by computation. The cluster will also offer opportunities for high-school teachers and their students via NSF funded teachers summer camps to learn about computational materials science.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will develop state-of-the-art computational approaches and apply them to fundamentally important problems in condensed matter physics and materials science. The researchers will investigate fundamental problems associated with correlated electron systems and demonstrate novel physical phenomena emerging in complex materials. The improved understanding and quantitative prediction based on computational modeling on the complex properties of these interacting systems will provide valuable information and guidance for the theoretical and experimental research in the field. The scientists will study the electronic structure and spin transport of multifunctional nano-systems consisting of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric tunnel junctions based on multiferroics and topological insulator materials. The coupling between different degrees of freedom and its sensitivity to interfacial structure will give rise to a wealth of exciting phenomena, providing unprecedented access to emerging multi-functionalities of future spintronic devices. They will tackle a grand challenge in solar energy conversion, charge transfer and separation at donor/acceptor interfaces, which is the bottleneck for excitonic solar cells. A first principles based theoretical framework will be developed to address fundamental problems at the organic/organic and organic/inorganic interfaces.  The computational developments and the proposed research have the potential to provide fundamental understanding of important unresolved questions in areas of condensed matter physics and materials science, ranging from understanding new states of matter, topological characterization, unconventional superconductivity, and quantum phase transitions in strongly interacting electron and spin systems; to spin transport in ferromagnetic/ferroelectric tunnel junctions and spintronic devices; and to charge transfer and separation at donor/acceptor interfaces pertinent to solar cells.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     With this instrument grant,   we have performed the state-of-art computational research in three different directions.  First,  for strongly interacting systems,  we have identified new topological phases,  and  quantum states of matter,   which have potential application in advancing technology through quantum-mechanics based  computing. Our simulation  also provides fundamental understanding of the microscopic quantum systems of interesting to condensed matter field. Second, for materials possessing topological phase transition, one can use crystal symmetry and its breaking (through imperfection to the crystal structure) to induce quantum phase transition. By employing density functional calculations, we explored the parameter space associated with both band inversion and ferroelectric displacement. We predict a bulk gapless phase in a range of lattice constant  in which a new semimetal phase known as  Weyl nodes emerge and evolve in momentum space under hydrostatic pressure or external magnetic field.  This provides guidance to experimental advance.Third, energy independent, yet higher than 90% internal quantum efficiency  has been observed in many organic photovoltaics. However, its physical origin remains largely unknown and controversial. Our research establishes a firm link between microscopic interfacial structure and macroscopic device performance of photovoltaics, providing important clues for future device design and optimization.  Funded by NSF program, we have been developing three new courses in computational materials science that cover all necessary theoretical models and computational techniques in modeling real materials and physical processes. Students involved in our courses will be able to use our advanced new cluster (purchased by this MRI grant)  to do real-life simulations and master new pallele programming. We have incorporated new research into these courses, which will be taken by our advanced undergraduates and master students.  The first is a course on quantum mechanical ab initio materials simulation methods; the second is on molecular simulations of materials that focus on statistical modeling of materials, including Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations; and the third one will be devoted to many-body quantum condensed matter physics. In each of these courses, substantial time is spent on teaching bridging concepts needed to understand the connection between methods at various scales. The student chooses a project in which he/she develops and runs simulation codes for various materials applications. We just set up this cluster from last summer,  and we expect that more than 40 students will take the courses over a period of two years.  Many of the students will be recruited by the PI and co-PIs to carry out research projects outlined here. This year there are  eight students working with us. The training students receive from taking the courses will be greatly beneficial to them once they start their research projects.The education and training will provide students with necessary skills in seeking research and industry  jobs in the chemical, electronics, automotive, aerospace, and semiconductor industries.
