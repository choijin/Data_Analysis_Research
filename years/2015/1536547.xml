<AbstractNarration>Human carbon dioxide emissions are causing measureable changes in ocean conditions. Many of these changes negatively affect coral reef ecosystems, reducing their ability to provide food, arable land, tourist destinations and coastline protection for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This project focuses on the effects of enhanced stratification, caused by ocean warming, on the growth of reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Bermuda. Enhanced stratification impacts primary productivity which generates food for corals.  Initial data generated by the investigators suggest that Atlantic coral growth has declined in the last 5 decades in response to these changes. A laboratory-based experiment is designed to test this hypothesis. If verified, the projected decline in Atlantic primary productivity through the 21st century could potentially rival and will certainly exacerbate the effects of warming and ocean acidification on coral reef ecosystems across the North Atlantic. Support is provided for graduate research, and undergraduate participation is facilitated through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Summer Fellowship and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences-Princeton Environmental Institute Summer Internship Programs. The results will be presented at national and international meetings and disseminated in a timely manner through peer-reviewed publications. All data produced through this program will be archived in the Biological and Chemical Oceanographic Data Management Office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a principle threat to coral reef survival in the 21st century. In addition to ocean warming and acidification, global climate models project enhanced stratification of the upper oceans through the 21st century and a consequent decline in productivity, by up to 50%, in the North Atlantic. This project employs controlled laboratory manipulation experiments to test the link between productivity and growth of the dominant reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Bermuda. Preliminary data generated by the investigators, including multi-decade long coral growth histories and nitrogen isotope ratios of coral tissue and skeleton, suggest that coral growth across the region has declined over the past 50 years in response to productivity changes already underway. If the link between ocean circulation, productivity decline, and coral growth is verified, the projected 21st century decline in productivity could rival and will certainly exacerbate the effects of warming and ocean acidification on North Atlantic coral reef ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Some tropical corals in the Atlantic have experienced slowing growth rates over the last several decades and the projections are for this to continue with the threats of ocean acidification and warming. Many climate change models also predict that vertical mixing&mdash;in which water rich in plankton and other organic matter are carried from the deep to the surface layers of the ocean&mdash;will be weakened. Therefore, a reduced food supply (heterotrophy) due to changing ocean circulation could be a third significant impact on coral growth and survival. Through a collaborative project with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Princeton University and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, we investigated the link between ocean nitrogen concentrations, coral feeding, and coral health.</p> <p>Specifically for this portion of the collaborative award in Bermuda, we conducted a laboratory-based coral culture experiment at the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Sciences designed to increase our understanding of the factors influencing nitrogen isotope incorporation into corals (the coral tissue and the algal symbionts, known as zooxanthellae). We were testing whether the coral&rsquo;s nitrogen isotopic composition is affected by the consumption of different quantities of externally produced organic matter (i.e. heterotrophic feeding), without changes to the isotopic composition of the food source. We were also examining to what extent light and the impact of photosynthesis by the zooxanthellae, as well as the internal nitrogen cycling between the coral and zooxanthellae, affects this process. We used new coral recruits (Figure 1), i.e. juveniles that were settled from larvae, of the common mustard hill coral, so that our experimental corals spent their whole lives in the treatment conditions, allowing us to accurately sample the nitrogen isotope ratios. We constructed a biofilter that effectively removed all nitrogen from the intake water to the culture aquaria. This meant we were able to control all sources of nitrogen to the corals in culture. This research is ongoing at Princeton University but the analyses so far suggest that light does not have any significant affect on the coral nitrogen isotope ratios and increased feeding does not cause a breakdown of the coral-zooxanthellae internal nitrogen cycling. Frequent feeding increased growth rates by over 50% compared to low fed conditions, and increased zooxanthellae densities and chlorophyll a content. Light levels did not have a significant effect on growth rates. Food availability likely has a strong influence on the success of juvenile corals.</p> <p>In conjunction with these laboratory coral experiments we conducted a field study at several sites across the Bermuda platform to better constrain how the coral nitrogen isotope ratios are reflecting those of the fixed nitrogen in its environment.

There was a gradient in food availability as well as in isotopic composition of the food sources across the Bermuda platform due to anthropogenic influences nearshore. Our initial results suggest that the gradients across the platform observed in the corals can be explained by gradients in the potential food sources.
