<AbstractNarration>High-end prosthetic feet have been developed to improve the mobility and function of lower-limb amputees, but a majority of amputees in the Developing World lack access to this technology.  Most current Developing World prosthetic solutions do not adequately address the needs of active amputees and were not designed to pass international standard tests. Current assistive devices available range from the ultra-low cost Red Cross system to high-end systems produced by the big European manufacturers. With the focus on customers at the extreme ends of the economic spectrum there remains a niche in the market for a mid-range, trans-femoral prosthetic leg that is both affordable and high-quality.  The current gap in this market will be magnified in the future by projected population growth, an increasingly aging global population, and the growing prevalence of vascular disease, leaving leading to an estimated 35 million amputees in the target market needing a prosthetic foot within 3 years.  The World Health Organization has issued the call for projects and organizations that are focused on providing assistive health technologies that are both affordable and high-quality. This project seeks to answer that call by developing a low-cost, repairable, adjustable, highly functional prosthetic foot to close the technological gap and improve the outcomes for the world?s neediest amputees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students at the University of Texas at El Paso have created an energy storage and return prosthetic foot that is low cost, adaptable to a wide range of patient needs and repairable.  The foot's toe section consists of several interchangeable layers.  The purpose of these layers is to create a foot whose stiffness is variable and can be customized to match the weight, stride and activity level of the amputee wearing the foot.  Layers are constructed by hand laying carbon fiber and epoxy into compression molds in a process that can be replicated in virtually any lab or manufacturing space.  Three different layer stiffnesses, created by varying the fiber orientations in the layers of carbon fiber, offer the ability to customize the stiffness of the foot through a variety of layer combinations.  A prosthetist using this technology would have a selection of standard layers in each of those three stiffnesses that can be combined to match the needs of his patient without having to order a custom foot.  The stiffness of the foot can also be easily modified after it is in use if the patient finds it to be uncomfortable.  The foot currently exists as a prototype with preliminary lab and patient testing done.  Future work must include some small design changes and additional testing for further validation by ISO standards.  Further customer discovery is also needed to ensure the value propositions of the project resonate with real customers from the program coordinator level to technicians who fit the device to the amputees themselves.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF I-Corps / Gonzalez / Outcomes Report  The purpose of this project was to investigate the commercial potential of a low-cost prosthetic foot technology developed at the University of Texas at El Paso.  The investigation focused on customer discovery in the US and abroad to establish the market for the technology and determine how the footÆs value propositions line up with real customer needs.  A preliminary assessment indicated a potential market for low-income patients in clinics in the US with a much larger market throughout the developing world through sales to directors of for-profit and non-profit prosthetic clinics.  The team responsible for the market research consisted of the PI, an Industry Mentor and an Entrepreneurial Lead.  Together the team members worked to find potential customers and execute interviews beginning here in the US and extending overseas as well.  The Entrepreneurial Lead traveled to strategic locations in Cambodia, Bangladesh and India to complete the scope of the grant.   Traveling abroad was a vital component of this customer search, as the project was motivated in part by the WHOÆs call for affordable, high-quality assistive devices in the GATE initiative (Global Cooperation on Assistive Technology).  Various sites throughout Asia were selected because of professional connections through the Industry Mentor and their potential to yield useful results.  A trip to Cambodia enabled the team to gain insights from both prosthetic specialists and end users.  Exceed, a major player in prosthetic training and services throughout Southeast Asia runs a network of clinics in Cambodia, providing a convenient cross section of customers all within one country.  The trip to Bangladesh provided access to a good number of specialists and patients at a charitable clinic in another region.  Finally, the trip to India exposed us to a range of other companies who are offering competing technologies in South Asia.  Early on in the discovery process, it was apparent that the effort to market the foot in the United States would be very difficult and essentially eliminate the low-cost component of the invention.  American customers consistently told us that our project cannot succeed in the US because the entire domestic prosthetics industry is defined by the rules of the insurance companies.  In the current system, prosthetic feet are given pricing codes based on function without consideration for manufacturing cost.  As a result, the foot would be assigned a fee consistent with much more costly products already on the market.  This teamÆs product is not positioned to compete with those established companies and products without the low-cost benefit.  Overseas the device has a much greater chance for success, but the feedback from customers has made it clear that a shift in technology priorities will be important moving forward.  The original project focused heavily on achieving accurate fit and high functionality without addressing the physical appearance of the device.  Customers consistently emphasized a high value on cosmetic appeal as well as the desire for more a more durable foot.  In light of the findings under this grant, the team is focusing on creating a cover for the foot to make it look more natural and simplifying the design to improve durability and further lower the cost of production.
