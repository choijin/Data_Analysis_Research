<AbstractNarration>Ebola virus spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials contaminated with these fluids. Hstar Technologies is developing and validating the Advanced Mobile Lifting and Transferring Robotic Nursing Assistant for Contagious Patients as a viable means for transporting patient without direct contact by care givers. A unique linkage system allows powerful, safe, and flexible lifting and positioning of the patient with a minimal number of actuators. The lifting mechanism is mounted on a low profile, stable and flexible footprint robotic mobile base for various terrains and among buildings. A simple, intuitive user interface allows control by a single caregiver with minimal training beside the robot or remotely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research includes developing feasible and novel cooperative nurse-robot protocols that will result in healthcare enhancement for both patients and caregivers. This project utilizes rapidly deployable, articulated robotic arms with gentle conveyor belts in reaction of urgent outbreak of contagious disease. Hstar Technologies is drawing upon its expertise in autonomous mobile platform, human robot interaction, operation control, robotic dexterous manipulation, and haptics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rapid advances in robotics, medical informatics, and communication are transforming the modern hospital, increasing the precision and accuracy of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, streaming access to health information, and enhancing patient safety. These modernization efforts include, for instance, the installation of robotic surgery systems that enhance the surgeonÆs efficiency and accuracy. Similarly, hospitals are using telepresence technologies to enable remote monitoring of patients and to allow consultation among clinicians and patients in remote locations.  A persistent&mdash;if less glamorous&mdash;challenge in hospitals lies in the day-to-day work for patients with impaired mobility. This is a challenge intensified by our burgeoning aging population, the obesity epidemic, and our aging healthcare workforce.  Given the critical shortage of direct care hospital personnel, particularly nursing staff, this is a challenge that merits further investment in technological innovation.     A growing problem: With the global population growing from 4 to 7.2 billion over the last 40 years, large urban centers throughout the developing world are overcrowded, ideal for the emergence of infectious diseases. Moreover, with increased travel, clinicians see increasing numbers of patients with exotic diseases acquired abroad. Extensive cross-species contact among humans and certain domestic animals can dictate antigenic shifts in influenza viruses.    Given the strained resources at hand to deal with sudden disease outbreaks, it is essential to maximize both safety and efficiency in handling patients. This includes increasing safety in transfer and patient movement and minimization of disease spread to workers.     Hazards to healthcare workers: Ebola virus, for example, spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. Health-care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD). This has occurred through "close" contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced. Specifically, aid workers are positioning close with the victim while assisting the transition from place to place (e.g., between bed to wheelchair).   What is essential is improving methods for safe and isolated handling of contagious patient. New methods are also needed to increase the bandwidth of facilities deployed to care for epidemics and increase healthcare worker efficiency with each patient.     Use of robotic assistance in treating infectious disease patients: Hstar Technologies is leading the development of a new category of clinical systems, the Robotic Nursing Assistant Lift (RoNA), to strengthen and transform the nurseÆs leading role as protector and driver of quality patient care.  Doing so will free clinical staff to devote more time to higher level, patient critical functions, while performing those lower level tasks reliably and more cost effectively. Successful implementation of this system will help hospitals to become "Center for Excellence" in the reduction/prevention of healthcare workersÆ infection from contaminated victims and lifting related injuries and improve both patient and staff satisfaction.  RoNA system delivers core benefits associated with safe patient handling that include: 1) Reduced incidence of clinician workplace injuries, and associated workmanÆs compensation claims and lost work time, 2) Fewer patient falls and injuries due to improper / unsafe lifting, 3) Improved clinician staff retention and satisfaction, 4) Improved patient satisfaction and patient referrals, 5) Reduction in healthcare worker exposure risk via reduction in number of healthcare workers needed for lifting team from team of four to one or none (when working completely remote operatio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
