<AbstractNarration>The Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences offers postdoctoral research fellowships to provide opportunities for recent doctoral graduates to obtain additional training, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond their undergraduate and graduate training. Postdoctoral fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including at foreign locations. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports a rising scholar in the field of social psychology researching racial bias. There are many perspectives about the operation of racial bias in society, and yet, people often shirk away from conversations about racial issues-of-the-day because they can be tense and uncomfortable. Indeed, disagreement during conversations about racial bias typically engenders defensiveness, anger, and withdrawal?other-focused emotions that inhibit perspective-taking and downstream attitudinal and behavioral change. This research program combines social psychological scholarship on confronting racial bias, self-regulation, and interracial interactions to identify strategies that will temper these feelings of defensiveness. More specifically, this project explores how Whites respond to different styles of feedback (i.e., confrontation) during conversations about bias. Additionally, this project explicitly tests whether self-regulation training that provides insight into one?s own propensity for racial bias will improve Whites? reactions to confrontation. Achieving greater insight into how confrontation targets feel and respond in face-to-face interactions, and whether this differs based on the race of the confronter or the style that individual uses, can inform ways to engage majority group allies when working toward racial equality and social change. An additional benefit of this work is its applicability for creating diversity and inclusion workshops that promote self-driven change, instead of ones that result in other-focused (i.e., defensive) reactions that can lead to backlash. Taken together, this research will provide practical knowledge about how to confront and discuss racial bias in ways that will motivate individuals toward social change and foster mutual understanding of the relevance and prevalence of racial bias in today?s society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present studies advance social psychological theory by exploring how people respond to different types of racial bias confrontation. Building on self-determination theory and the self-regulation model of prejudice, four experiments empirically test how Whites respond to confrontation that emphasizes compliance with social norms (i.e., a controlling strategy) compared to confrontation that emphasizes compliance with personal egalitarian standards (i.e., an autonomy-supportive strategy). The first study uses a free-recall paradigm to explore whether Whites spontaneously distinguish between autonomy-supportive and controlling confrontations, and how this affects their attitudes, behavior, and perceptions of racial bias confronters. The subsequent experiments test whether safety cues from the confronter (i.e., shared racial group) and safety cues from the self (i.e., training that emphasize one?s propensity for racial bias and self-regulation) temper negative reactions to controlling racial bias confrontation. The final study mimics real-world conversations about race by examining how Whites respond to face-to-face confrontation, and whether safety cues (from others, and the self) encourage more positive, perceivable differences in the confrontation target?s behavior. In sum, the present research extends past work by identifying when and why racial bias confrontation interferes with self-regulatory processes, and by creating ways to intervene to encourage engagement in future intergroup contact.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Confrontation, or any statement or behavior that signals disagreement or disapproval with bias, is critical for curbing bias. However, many people are reluctant to acknowledge and confront bias when it does occur due to concerns about what to say, how to say it, and whether interpersonal relationships will suffer as a result. Self-determination theory suggests that people can use autonomy-supportive or autonomy-restrictive motivational framing to encourage behavioral change. Autonomy-supportive framing emphasizes a personal choice to behave in a particular way, relatedness with others, and competency. Autonomy-restrictive framing emphasizes societal obligations and external demands as motivations for behavior. A critical goal of this project was to understand how people confront bias in everyday situations. We also sought to examine, with laboratory experiments, which motivational framing yielded more or less effective confrontations, and whether this differed based on the race of confronter. Taken together, three studies examined how motivational framings shaped people&rsquo;s emotional reactions, attitudes, and behavior following confrontation.</p> <p>When asked about their past confrontation experiences, about 70% of participants could recall a time that they were involved in a confrontation. Most frequently, people confronted by scolding the person who made the biased comment, using evidence to refute the statement, or displaying disapproval nonverbally (e.g., eye rolling, walking away). Interestingly, these strategies were used differently depending on whether the person was confronting a stereotype, racial slur, or joke; stereotypes were more likely to elicit evidence-based confrontations, and racial slurs or jokes were more likely to elicit scolding. In addition, we learned that both autonomy-supportive and autonomy-restrictive framings were equally successful in prompting emotional reactions, like guilt and discomfort, which are related to long-term attitude change. However, the autonomy-supportive framing was more likely than the autonomy-restrictive framing to prompt interpersonal closeness between the confronter and the person responsible for the biased comment. Thus, these studies reveal that any confrontation can be effective, but it also highlights best-practices for confronting (i.e., autonomy-supportive framing) that address one key barrier to confronting bias&mdash;concerns about preserving interpersonal relationships.</p> <p>&nbsp;Next, we conducted an experiment in which White participants with relatively negative attitudes toward contemporary racial issues had a conversation about racial bias in policing with either a White or Black partner (a confederate actor). During the conversation, the confederate used one of the two motivational framings to confront statements made by the participant. Afterward, participants answered questions about how they felt about the conversation and their partner, and responded to items concerning their attitudes. Analyses are ongoing, but preliminary results show a number of important outcomes. Regardless of confrontation style and partner race, participants felt more negative self-directed affect and tension and less positive affect after the conversation than before. Also regardless of the experimental factors, participants were significantly less likely to agree with negative attitude statements (i.e., &ldquo;Race is getting more attention than it should in discussions about police procedures than it should&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blacks are responsible for creating most of the racial tension that exists in the United States today&rdquo;) after the confrontational conversation, compared to in a prescreening completed weeks prior. In addition, regardless of confrontation style and partner race, participants were inclined to believe that their partner&rsquo;s points were valid and would prompt them to think differently in the future.

Nonetheless, we also found that, compared to autonomy-supportive confrontation, autonomy-restrictive confrontation generated greater negative other-directed affect and negative partner impressions (e.g., antagonistic, unfriendly), engendered less feelings of similarity and relatability with one&rsquo;s partner, and caused less desire for future contact.
