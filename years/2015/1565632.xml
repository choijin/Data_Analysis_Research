<AbstractNarration>Thomas Beck of the University of Cincinnati is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to develop new computational methods to study ions in liquids.  Ions are charged atomic or molecular species that can dissolve in solvents like water or organic liquids.  Ions are important in a very broad range of natural and technological systems.  Table salt is the most common everyday example, but ions of many kinds figure prominently in electrochemistry, colloids, surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors).  Not all ions are the same; in fact, the ion identity (through its size, shape, and chemistry) can dramatically affect the properties of a given system.  The focus of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of what causes such large differences between ionic species.  This research aids in developing more accurate models for how the ions interact with solvents such as water or organic liquids (such as ethylene carbonate, the solvent in the lithium (Li)-ion batteries used in every electronic device).  Towards this end, Beck and his coworkers employ accurate models that come from the fundamental theory of nature, quantum mechanics.  Their goal is to learn about basic aspects of ion solvation and then produce reliable models that can help understand problems like atmospheric chemistry and the development of longer-lasting batteries.  The educational component of this project centers on continued development of a course on sustainable energy.  Professor Beck is currently the chair of the State Users Group at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, with over 1000 active computational science users. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses fundamental aspects of ion solvation in water and organic solvents.  Ion solvation figures prominently in surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors).  Beck and his coworkers aim to establish a fundamental energy scale for single-ion solvation.  This allows for a firmer groundwork for studying specific ion effects.  The research also leads to the development of better classical models that can be applied to much larger systems such as sea salt aerosols and improved batteries.  The behavior of ions near interfaces is an essential aspect of all of these problems.  The research has four objectives: to study ions in water, in organic solvents, and in biological channels, and to further develop a new stochastic algorithm for quantum simulations on parallel computers.  The study of ions in water leads to the accurate prediction of the effective surface potential of water, a long sought quantity in condensed phase chemistry.  This work employs ab initio quantum simulations and quasi-chemical theory to obtain quantitative estimates of the bulk and real hydration free energies.  The study of ions in organic solvents applies the same ideas to ions in ethylene carbonate, a key electrolyte in Li-ion batteries.  That research improves current models for these systems.  The study of ions in biological channels examines the interaction of protons and chloride ions in the bacterial CLC channel protein.  The development of stochastic algorithims may lead to a new forward-looking algorithm for large-scale quantum simulations. The method employs stochastic differential equations to solve for the one-particle density matrix.  Besides the scientific impacts, the research broadly impacts education through development of a course on sustainable energy and leadership of the State Users Group at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, with over 1000 active computational science users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ions dissolve in liquids that have high dielectric constants.  Examples include water and organic liquids such as cyclic carbonates used in lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors.  Over the last century our understanding of ions in liquids has evolved from simple models in which ions are treated as simple charged spheres to more accurate quantum mechanical models that include the real chemical complexities of the ion-solvent interactions.  This grant produced theoretical and computational research that improved our understanding of how ions and solvent molecules interact, and how widely different solvents dissolve the ions.  In addition, the work has laid the foundation for more accurate studies of driving forces leading to specific ion effects.  These effects appear in a wide variety of important chemical, industrial, biological, and energy related systems.  In terms of intellectual merit, the research examined fundamental aspects of ion solvation in water. The results include a study that produced a conclusive prediction for the bulk hydration free energy of the sodium ion.  Along with the experimental free energy result that includes the ion interaction with the water surface, the quantum mechanical computational result yields an effective surface potential value of -0.4 V, consistent with earlier results funded by NSF.  Establishing an absolute single-ion free energy scale and the surface potential of water have been long-sought goals in condensed phase chemistry.  In addition, classical simulations were employed to explore the origin of the ?Law of Matching Water Affinities? which suggest that like-sized ions are attracted to each other in water.  Understanding ion association helps to develop better chemical formulations with optimal characteristics, for example.  Studies were also performed to help explain the widely varying behavior of ions near the water surface due to the water multipole moments and ion properties; this work has impacts in atmospheric chemistry, electrochemistry, catalysis, colloid science, and biology.  Further research examined the thermodynamics of ion solvation in ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate in order to compare/contrast with comparable studies in water. Comparison of classical and quantum models showed clearly the important role of molecular polarization when the results were compared with experiments.  These results will lead to the development of more accurate molecular models for ion behavior in batteries.  Finally, extensive research was performed that investigated ion binding and transport in CLC chloride transporter proteins.  This fascinating family of membrane proteins controls the flow of negative ions into and out of cells, often coupled with proton transport.  The research overall has broad impacts in multiple fields of condensed matter chemistry, with direct applications to surface chemistry, catalysis, electrochemistry, biophysics, and the energy sciences.  The results will lead to the development of more accurate force fields for molecular simulation studies that can be used to examine a wide range of chemical systems.

The grant also supported outreach activities related to engaging a more diverse set of students in computational science at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, where the PI served as the State Users Group Chair for 3 years.  The PI also developed a new Sustainable Energy and Society course that examined the large-scale issues related to energy production and consumption around the world, and the challenges facing developed and under-developed economies over the next several decades and beyond.  The course has been taught to students ranging from first-year undergraduates to graduate students.  Several public lectures on sustainable energy have been delivered through the Cincinnati Museum Center and the University of Cincinnati Sustainability effort.
