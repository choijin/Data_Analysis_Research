<AbstractNarration>Adults often find it difficult to learn a second language.  Some adult learners do manage to successfully achieve native-like performance in a second language, but how that occurs or what helps the learner is still unknown. The planned studies will investigate a new hypothesis that proposes that successful adult learners are individuals who are able to tolerate change in their native language. The changes that may be required to enable successful adult language learning may involve processing costs that initially slow the native language and make native language performance more error prone, make learners less sensitive to some features of the native language, and that open the native language to the influences of the language being learned. The project asks whether some adults are better able to accommodate the changes to the native language and, as a result, are more likely to succeed in mastering a second language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, the investigators will examine learners at different levels of proficiency in typical classroom learning contexts, immersed in English in the US or in Spanish in Spain. Changes to the native language will be examined at the level of the lexicon and the grammar, comparing comprehension and production, using behavioral measures of speed and accuracy, eye tracking measures during reading, and electrophysiological measures that examine the earliest time course of language processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has a number of broader implications for improving adult second language learning. It can also inform educational issues in a society in which many learners, e.g., immigrant adolescents, are faced with the task of acquiring a second language past the earliest stages of childhood and for whom failure in this task is associated with poor academic, social, and economic outcomes. The research will  contribute to the training of a diverse group of cognitive scientists by involving both undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are bilinguals or second language learners themselves, and will foster an international scientific collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

Although many past studies have investigated the factors that make learning a second language difficult, the published research has not been successful at proposing a satisfactory explanation. With support from the National Science Foundation, we explored a new hypothesis: that the difficulty that adult learners experience in acquiring a second language after early childhood is related to their ability to regulate the native language (L1). What do we mean by ?regulate?? Recent studies on bilingualism demonstrate that the two languages in proficient bilinguals are supported by the same brain systems; hence, the bilingual?s two languages continually interacting with one another. Skilled bilinguals, therefore, need to regulate or<em> control</em> the use of their L1 when learning an L2 to be able to reduce interference from the L1. The studies conducted in this grant monitored language performance in the L1 and also in the L2, in learners at the first stages of foreign language study, in learners who were slightly more advanced, and in monolingual speakers. For all learners, the L1 was English and the L2 was Spanish. The grant had two main aims. The first was to determine whether L1 performance differed in learners relative to closely matched monolingual speakers. The second was to ask at what point and in what ways the L2 begins to affect the L1 during the course of second language learning.</p> <p>&nbsp;We examined changes to the L1 at the word and at the grammar level. For the word-level studies, we capitalized on the ?the cognate facilitation effect.? Cognates are words that are written with similar orthography and have the same meaning in two languages (English <em>tomato</em> and Spanish <em>tomate</em>). Evidence indicates that cognate words are processed more quickly than non-cognate words, leading to a ?cognate facilitation.? In the experiments conducted in the grant, our index of the influence of the L2 on the L1 was whether words like ?tomato? in English were processed differently by English learners of Spanish. Native English speakers learning Spanish were tested when they began to study Spanish and three weeks later. Figure 1 reveals the changes for learners from Session 1 (in English) to Session 3 (also in English). These data represent a portion of the averaged EEG data (EEG stands for electroencephalogram and reflects records of brain activity while participants were performing the word-level task), and compared the beginning learners of Spanish to heritage learners of Spanish for whom English has become the dominant language. The heritage speakers are not proficient in Spanish but have exposure to Spanish. In Session 1, the beginning learners show little influence of Spanish on English, whereas the heritage learners show an effect of Spanish on English. By Session 3, the effect of cognate status in Spanish is beginning to affect performance in English in both groups of learners.</p> <p>&nbsp;We illustrate changes to the L1 at the level of the grammar with a study that examined word order differences in English and Spanish. &nbsp;When describing a person or an object in English, adjectives precedes the entity being described (e.g., the <em>blue</em> envelop?where <em>blue</em> is an adjective). In Spanish, however, the word order is reversed, such that the adjective follows the entity being described (e.g., el sobre az?l (literally, the envelop <em>blue</em>). The goal of the sentence-level experiments was to examine the cost that English learners of Spanish and monolingual English speakers would experience in producing phrases in their native language (English) that reflected Spanish word order. The logic was that if the L2 influences the L1 during second language learning, then the learners of Spanish (by virtue of the fact that they are beginning to learn Spanish grammar) would have more difficulty to produce English sentences with Spanish Noun-Adj (N-Adj) word order relative to monolingual English speakers. And this is what we found. &nbsp;In one experiment, participants saw pictures of colored objects and were asked to name each object along with its color name in English.
