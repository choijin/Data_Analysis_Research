<AbstractNarration>The central mid-Atlantic region of the eastern North America margin is the focus of ongoing studies of rift processes. The region presents the opportunity to understand the role of pre-existing lithospheric weakness in guiding past continental rifting. The tectonic plate at this currently 'passive' margin thins through the transition from continental to oceanic crust, yet details of the topography on the base of the plate, as well as the properties of the underlying ductile mantle are not known. This information can provide clues about how Earth's tectonic plates evolve over time and why continents break up in the pattern that they do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determination of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) remains controversial, despite this boundary being one of the most fundamental aspects of the plate tectonics paradigm. In addition to limited knowledge about the topography on the base of the lithosphere, constraints on the properties of the uppermost asthenosphere immediately beneath the plate, are poor.  Various interpretations have been presented to explain seismic observations across the margin, including a remnant thermal perturbation from a mantle plume, a hydrous upper mantle and the presence of partial melt. However, the thermal perturbation model is not consistent with a dramatically thinned lithosphere. This study will use magnetotelluric data to bring new constraints to the problem. Processing of data from 14 seafloor instruments deployed across the continental shelf offshore Martha's Vineyard, MA, and 2 stations  on land will be accomplished. A 2-D resistivity model of the upper-mantle structure will be obtained and interpreted in terms of lithospheric alteration resulting from the influence of the Great Meteor hotspot. The depth to the LAB, the nature of the deeper continental lithosphere and whether melt is present at the top of the asthenosphere will be investigated.</AbstractNarration>

The results have been published in Attias et al. (2017), a paper that was written by a graduate student visiting Woods Hole on an exchange program with Southampton University in the UK.  The Easternmost portion of the US continent, including the part of the continent that extends beneath the ocean, is of great geologic interest. Roughly 200 million years ago, the region was connected to Europe as part of the Pangea supercontinent.

We also seek to better understand the nature of the transition from rigid lithosphere to convecting asthenosphere below, and whether there are structures imageable within the lithosphere related to the continental break-up or rifting.  MT is a geophysical technique used to image deep into the Earth. The method measures naturally occurring electric and magnetic fields at the Earth?s surface, generated by the interaction of the Earth?s magnetic field and the charged particles of the solar wind. These charged particles create electric currents in the ionosphere which, in turn, induce current flow within the Earth. The pattern of current flow beneath Earth?s surface is dependent on the electrical conductivity structure, a physical property sensitive to temperature, composition and particularly the presence of fluids.  MT data have been widely used to understand variations in lithospheric structure and properties of the asthenosphere in continental and oceanic settings and have added significant insight into our understanding of the processes occurring through the upper mantle, particularly those relating to mantle hydration (strength) and melting.  To that end, we used MT data collected across the continental shelf offshore Martha?s Vineyard, MA, through two prior and separate sea-going campaigns.    Generating models of the Earth from MT data involves a process called numerical inversion that finds an optimal model that agrees with the data.
