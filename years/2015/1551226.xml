<AbstractNarration>The oxygen isotope compositions of natural materials have been used for over 60 years as a quantitative 'thermometer' for ancient rock and mineral samples. The difference in the oxygen isotope composition (the 18O/16O ratio) of a mineral and the water from which it formed provides a temperature estimate that has a precision of ~1°C. The problem with application of this method to ancient samples is that the water - usually ocean water - is not preserved in the rock and needs to be inferred. This introduces some ambiguity to the derived paleotemperature estimate. Namely, was the oxygen isotope composition of the ocean water at the time the mineral formed the same as it is today? Researchers have been tackling this question for decades, and it is still unresolved. In this proposal, the team will use a novel, previously untried, technique in which all three naturally occurring oxygen isotopes are used for temperature determinations. It has long been thought that the rare isotope 17O provides no additional information to the commonly measured 18O/16O ratios. More recently, this team and other research groups have shown that there are subtle differences in the way temperature affects the 18O/16O and 17O/16O ratios. By accurately measuring all three isotopes, 16O, 17O and 18O, it is proposed to eliminate the uncertainties inherent in using the 18O/16O ratios alone. This award will help support the graduate theses of two students, one of whom is a woman, the other a minority. It will also include research opportunities for an undergraduate student, allowing them hands-on access to sophisticated laboratory equipment. Such an opportunity is invaluable for young potential scientists. Both the investigator and the graduate students will work closely with undergraduate students recruited over the three year time frame of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a new research avenue and there are many outstanding questions. As part of our research, they will calibrate the temperature dependence on the 18O/16O and 17O/16O ratios of quartz and water by experimentally equilibrating a quartz-water mixture at high temperatures and pressures. They will expand the preliminary tests of the technique to the very important mineral calcite. Marine carbonates are ubiquitous in the rock record, and if the approach works for calcite it will vastly expand the research potential of this new technique. Unfortunately, the analysis of calcite for 17O/16O ratios has proven to be very difficult. This research group will initially spend time conducting analytical tests to quantifying this measurement and reproduce it for a standard. Once the methodology is further established, they will proceed to analyze some of the most pristine, ancient samples in order to test the age-old question 'Is the oxygen isotope composition of ancient seawater the same as it is today?' At the same time, they will apply this work to high temperature systems as a way of retrieving both temperatures and fluid compositions (sources) in hydrothermal systems. This work will have important applications to the economic geology community which strives to understand how mineral deposits form.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research conducted from this grant involved quantifying the triple isotope thermometer for low and high temperature applications. It is recognized that the three isotopes of oxygen (18-O, 17-O, 16-O) provide more information about a mineral?s condition of formation than do the traditional 18-O/16-O alone. A primary goal was to quantify the carbonate triple-isotope paleothermometer. We needed to develop a method of analysis, develop standards for the system and calibrated the isotope thermometer. This work was the thesis of Jordan Wostbrock. She first developed a high-temperature fluorination method for quantitative 100% release of diatomic oxygen from a carbonate. With this analytical tool in place, our team determined the delta<sup>18</sup>O values of international carbonate, silicate, water and air standards so that laboratories could all present data on the same scale (Wostbrock et al., Chem. Geol., 2020). We also determined the triple isotope CO<sub>2</sub>-calcite fractionation associated with phosphoric acid digestion of calcite. A number of authors have used one of several methods to analyze the triple oxygen isotope value of CO<sub>2</sub> from carbonates. Our CO<sub>2</sub>-calcite fractionation allows them to back-calculate to the actual calcite value. The next task was to quantify the calcite-water triple isotope fractionation. We synthesized calcite in water with and without a catalyst (carbonic anhydrase) and analyzed modern marine shells that grew at known conditions. The results of this work lead to a quantified triple isotope calcite-water and aragonite-water thermometer (Wostbrock et al., Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 2020). It was recognized that there is a difference between natural samples and those that were catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. It appears that most natural samples are slightly out of thermodynamic equilibrium.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the calibration in place, we were able to apply the triple isotope thermometer to ancient samples. We are able to show apparent equilibrium in some shells and clear, inconclusive evidence of disequilibrium in others. We know of no other technique that definitively identifies diagentic disequilbrium. Fig. 1 shows two samples on a &Delta;'<sup>17</sup>O - delta<sup>18</sup>O (triple isotope) plot. The thick curved line is the equilibrium between a carbonate and ocean water (SMOW). Samples that plot on this line (blue circle) may be in equilibrium with ocean water. Samples that plot off this line (red circle) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot be in equilibrium with a modern seawater value</span>. This is the most definitive test for disequilibrium of ancient carbonates. The red sample in Fig. 1 falls off the equilibrium trend due to diagenetic alteration with a meteoric fluid. We are able to ?back-calculate? the original carbonate value with only a few assumptions about the diagenesis. Figure 2 shows the triple isotope data for a Devonian brachiopod. It plots to the left of the equilibrium curve. This is explained diagenetic alteration with a meteoric fluid. Three alteration paths, at different temperatures point to the original delta<sup>18</sup>O value of ~31?, corresponding to a formation temperature of ~18?C. Using triple isotopes, we can determine the original isotope composition and temperatures of formation. This has been applied to a number of samples (Wostbrock et al., MSA Rev. Min., 2020). It vastly improves our ability to determine paleotemperaures in the deep past.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have applied triple isotopes to high temperature systems. Wostbrock et al., (Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 2018) measured modern sinter forming in the high Andes, Chile and on the inside of a geothermal plant in Iceland. She found that the inorganic triple isotope fractionation and low-T organic fractionation curves are indistinguishable from one another. &nbsp;This is different from the carbonate-water system, which shows a subtle vital effect. An undergraduate senior honor?s thesis was undertaken on quartz veins and inclusions in and around the Sandia Granite (J. Helper, now a graduate student at U.T. Austin). We found that veins formed between 230 and 325?C in equilibrium with a meteoric derived fluid with a delta<sup>18</sup>O of ~-10? (Fig. 3). This work is in preparation for publication. Ph.D. student Eric Cano determined the bulk triple isotope composition of Earth and showed that the Moon was subtly different from the bulk mantle, with implications for the formation of the Moon (Cano et al., Nat. Geosci. 2020).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several outside projects that benefitted from the resources from this grant. We determined the triple isotope composition of Mn-oxides and recognized the incorporation of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> gas (Sutherland et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Lett, 2020) and applied the oxygen isotope thermometer to ultrahigh temperature samples from S. Madagascar (Holder et al., Geol., 2018).</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This work supported a full and partial Ph.D. student and two undergraduates, one of whom completed a senior honors thesis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/23/2020<br>      Modified by: Zachary&nbsp;D&nbsp;Sharp</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1551226/1551226_10409673_1590256168965_fig2alteration--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1551226/1551226_10409673_1590256168965_fig2alteration--rgov-800width.jpg" title="calcite-water alteration"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1551226/1551226_10409673_1590256168965_fig2alteration--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="calcite-water alteration"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2.
