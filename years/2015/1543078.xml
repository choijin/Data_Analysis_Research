<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a new design that transforms a standard, fixed displacement external spur gear machine (EGM), used in hydraulic motors and pumps, into a variable delivery flow machine that reduces energy demand and fuel consumption. This Variable Delivery - External Gear Machine (VD-EGM) technology offers energy-efficient, reliable and low-cost pumps and motors in engineering applications such as high pressure fluid power circuits (used in construction, agriculture, transportation, aerospace, manufacturing and entrainment) and low pressure fluid systems (fuel injection, washing systems, food and pharmaceutical industry). The VD-EGM concept preserves all typical advantages of EGMs, such as low cost, compactness, high efficiency, tolerance to both contaminants and cavitation, reliability; and it also permits application in efficient "flow on demand" systems layout configurations, for which traditional EGMs are not suitable. This will enable: 1) the use of more energy efficient system layouts in current applications of EGMs; 2) the use of EGMs in place of more expensive designs of variable displacement machines (such as axial piston pumps and vane pumps). As a consequence, the VD-EGM has the potential to impact almost all fluid power machines,  which currently handle about 3% of the total national energy consumption, offering significant fuel consumption reduction (up to 40%) without significant cost increase. Similarities in the design and appearance of the VD-EGM with respect to standard EGMs will allow for an easy acceptance of the novel concept into the fluid power market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in two functional prototypes (P1, P2): P1 will be a hydraulically operated VD-EGM suitable for power transmission systems involving high operating pressures (up to 250 bar), while P2 will be an electronically operated VD-EGM suitable for low pressure applications (up to 30 bar). To promote commercialization, the project will build a technology demonstrator, a hydraulic fan drive system, based on prototype P1. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is the novel principle for obtaining variable timing in EGMs, which uses asymmetric gear profile. This principle introduces an actuation system to modify the fluid dynamic features of the meshing process in such a way that a variable flow is delivered by the EGM. Although suitable to vary the displacement up to a certain range, this principle is applicable for both high- and low-pressure systems and enables high bandwidth associated with flow regulation. The research approach is based on a multi-objective numerical optimization procedure based on a detailed tribological model for EGM that has been created to assist the VD-EGM design. This procedure will advance knowledge not only about variable timing applications of EGMs, but also about the multiple physical characteristics of the meshing process and the displacing action of EGMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personnel involved in this project include, the project PI, two graduate level students and two undergraduate students which will receive innovation and technology translation experiences by overcoming the challenges related to the design of the actuation systems of prototypes P1 and P2 of the VD-EGM. The students will also work with a business entity (Purdue Office of Technology and Commercialization) through the project co-PI, and receive feedback from a gear pump manufacturers that will be instrumental for product commercialization.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This Accelerating Innovation Technology (AIT) project demonstrated the commercial viability of a novel concept for hydraulic pumps, for applications that range from generic fluid trasport systems, fuel injection systems, automotive transmission systems to high pressure fluid power applications. The novel concept is based on a variable timing principle realized on the design typical of external gear hydraulic machines, either pumps or motors (Fig. 1). The proposed innovation preserves the typical advantages of external gear machines, which are the low cost, good energy efficiency parameters, high reliability and tolerance to fluid contamination and cavitation. But it also enable the "flow on demand" capability, which permits to implement more energy efficient solutions, able to reduce energy consumptions up to 40%, depending on the application.&nbsp;</p> <p>This novel concept was first formulated by the PI Dr. Vacca within a previous NSF award through the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power (www.ccefp.org). The specific objective of this AIT<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em></em> project was to solve the technical barriers related to the actuation system of the unit that implements the flow regulation, and demonstrate its functionality through two functional prototypes. Specifically, the project successfully implemented and tested follwing prototypes:</p> <p>Prototype P1 (Fig. 2). A high pressure variable flow pump (suitable for operation up to 300 bar), demonstrating the new proposed technology for high power applications such as fluid power machines (hydraulic presses, mobile construction or agricultural equipment, aerospace).</p> <p>Prototype P2 (Fig. 3). A low pressure variable flow pump (suitable for operation up to 30 bar), demonstrating the technology for low power applications such as trasnmission systems, charge pumps, fluid transport system.&nbsp;</p> <p>The two prototypes demonstrate multiple concepts for applying the proposed variable timing technology. In particular, P1 shows how the flow actuation mechanism can be implemented as manual-operated or hydraulic-operated (pressure compensator); while P2 implements an electric regulation control system. Moreover, P1 proves the applicability of the concept on the pressure compensated design of external gear machines, which is typical for pumps operating at high pressure, Differently, P2 shows how the implementation of the proposed variable timing concept can be significantly simplified for the case of low pressure applications, reducing the implementation costs.</p> <p>The proposed concept relies on a proper design of the tooth profile of the gears, which can be considered as unconventional for common external gear machines. In particular, the gears have to realize longer regions of trapped volumes, so that the range of flow variation can be maximized. For this purpose, and also to realize prototypes offering good efficiency and optimal fluid dynamic features (low internal pressure peaks, limited regions for localized cavitation), the project utilized the numerical tool HYGESim (HYdraulic GEar machines Simulator) developed over the last year by Dr. Vacca's team. Significant effort was put in advanving the numerical tool, originally developed for conventional pumps, to permit the simulation of the proposed variable timing concept. Particularly, the tool was extended to novel geometries for the gears and to alternative features of the internal flow connections within the units. This modeling work benefitted not only this project, but allowed Dr. Vacca's team to study and publish findings about the effects of gear design parameters on the operation of traditional external gear machines. The two prototypes P1, P2 resulted as best designs from two optimization processes based on a combined Genetic Algorithm - Response Surface Methodology method.</p> <p>Both prototypes P1, P2 were built with parts fabricated at Purdue University (with the exception of the pump case for prototype P1, which was donated by a gear pump manufacturer). Experimental tests were perfomed at the Maha Fluid Power Research Center of Purdue University, which is the largest academic fluid power lab in the nation. A picture taken during one of the tests on prototype P2 is shown in Fig. 4.</p> <p>The test confirmed the numerical predictions and permitted to further validate the simulation model. In particular, both prototypes were able to reach a flow variation range of more of 35%, showing how the use of these units could permit similar levels of energy saving in many of the applications above mentioned.</p> <p>This NSF&nbsp;AITechnology project involved not only the project PIs, but also two master students (working in Dr. Vacca's team as Research Assistant), four undergraduate students (working under Dr. Vacca's supervision).
