<AbstractNarration>Researchers wish to understand the tempo of the rise of complex, populous societies from small founder groups and the pace of accompanying environmental change.  Archaeological study of Polynesian cultural sequences created on island ecosystems is well suited to such investigations.   Beginning with small bands of pioneering settlers, the first humans on the landscape of each newly discovered island, Polynesian societies of increasing size and hierarchical complexity developed over time.  This development was accompanied by environmental changes including profound modifications to native flora and fauna, landscapes, and marine resources. However, the timing of initial settlement and the tempo of ensuing cultural and environmental change remain highly uncertain despite nearly 70 years of research. In the current project, Drs. W. Sharp and P. Kirch and their collaborators Drs. M. Allen and G. Molle will further develop a novel approach to dating Polynesian cultural sequences.  The expected improvements in dating will, for the first time, provide a clear picture of the speed of cultural and environmental change in these Polynesian societies. Better dates in key Eastern Polynesian archipelagoes will also help resolve a longstanding debate over the timing of the extraordinary trans-Pacific dispersal of the Polynesians. Developing the capability to precisely date coral artifacts will help Pacific archaeologists erect refined chronologies for human occupation and human-ecosystem interaction elsewhere in Oceania.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polynesian archaeologists have traditionally depended almost solely upon radiocarbon dating (i.e., 14C dating) to provide a quantitative temporal framework for colonization of islands and subsequent evolution of island cultures and environments.  Despite significant improvements in the radiocarbon technique through the years, radiocarbon dating has severe inherent limitations when applied to the past ~1000 years, the time frame of cultural development in eastern Polynesia.  An alternative dating technique that has already demonstated considerable success in applications in Polynesia is 238U-234U-230Th dating of corals, herein referred to as 230Th coral dating.  The technique is based on decay of naturally occurring uranium in corals, and reliable 230Th coral ages with precisions of 1-2% are readily attainable.  For example, for 500-year old corals this translates into dates with uncertainties of only five to ten years.  In the current project, Sharp, Kirch and their collaborators will apply 230Th coral dating to coral abraders made from pieces of Acropora or other corals used by Polynesians to shape fish hooks made from shell.  Such coral abraders are common in Polynesian archaeological sequences and have been shown to be highly suitable for 230Th dating.  In sum, the project will provide chronologies for cultural sequences in key archipelagoes of Eastern Polynesia of unprecedented accuracy and precision, thereby substantively advancing our understanding of Polynesian prehistory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The expansion of humans from the closely spaced islands of the western Pacific into the vast eastern Pacific via long distance oceanic voyaging is the last great expansion of humankind into previously uninhabited areas.  The arrival of humans and associated plants and animals into pristine island ecosystems, and subsequent modifications to varied island environments through hundreds of years of cultural development and rising populations provide unique records of human-environment interactions.  Accurate and precise dating is needed to decipher this history. For six decades, Polynesian archaeologists have depended upon 14C dating to provide the temporal framework for their investigations, however, in spite of significant improvements over the years, 14C dating has severe inherent limitations in this context.  Foremost among these is the need to calibrate14C ages in order to correct for the effects of past variation in 14C levels in Earth's atmosphere.  The 14C calibration curve is well known but its complex shape can induce large errors in calibrated 14C ages.  See Figure 1.  Accordingly, alternative dating methods are needed to resolve current debates and problems in Polynesian cultural history. 230Th dating of corals from archaeological contexts, based on the decay of trace amounts of uranium incorporated into corals as they grow, has already proven effective in providing high-precision chronologies for temple construction and occupation sites in Hawai'i and Mo'orea, and for dating the first settlement of Western Polynesia. Our project has extended the application of 230Th dating to one of the most common artifact types in central Eastern Polynesian archaeological sites: abraders of Acropora and Porites coral. Small pieces of fresh coral were used for a variety of shaping and smoothing tasks by Polynesians, such as fashioning fishhooks from mollusk shells.  As a result, such coral fragments are common in Polynesian archaeological sites and sequences.  Dating the last increment of coral growth prior to use can provide a close constraint on the timing of associated human activities.  The 230Th dating technique requires relatively few assumptions, does not require external calibration, and is capable of providing highly precise ages in the period of interest; e.g., 230Th ages for 1000-year-old corals have typical uncertainties of five to ten years.  The project has four primary goals: (1) Develop precise chronologies for key archaeological sites in the Mangareva, Marquesas, Cook Islands and Austral archipelagoes, thereby refining our understanding of the archipelagoes' cultural sequences. (2) Test the fit between the 230Th chronologies and existing 14C chronologies for these key sites. (3) Determine whether abrading tools made from both Acropora and Porites genera are equally appropriate as materials for precise dating. (4) Determine the &Delta;-R marine reservoir values for 14C dating through dual dating of coral abraders with 14C and 230Th, thereby aiding future radiocarbon dating and calibration of materials from marine environments (e.g., fishbone, shell, pelagic seabird bones).  Our first journal article from the project, "230Th dating of coral abraders from stratified deposits at Tangatatau Rockshelter, Mangaia, Cook Islands: Implications for building precise chronologies in Polynesia", appeared in Journal of Archaeological Science in early 2019.  In it, we report twenty-five 230Th dates for Acropora and Porites coral abraders from a well-studied, stratified archaeological sequence at Tangatatau Rockshelter, Mangaia (site MAN-44, Cook Islands), develop novel screening criteria to identify reliable 230Th dates from buried contexts, and compare our 230Th dates on corals with a recent age model for the site based on 14C dates for short-lived plant materials.  We find that 230Th dates deemed reliable based on objective screening criteria cluster within individual layers, preserve stratigraphic order among layers, and generally agree with the previous 14C chronology but provide more precise dates (median &plusmn; 7.4 yr, 95% confidence level). These results indicate that 230Th dating of corals from stratified sequences has great potential for developing refined chronologies for Polynesian archaeological sites.   Synthesis of 230Th dates for corals from other sites (&gt;100 in all) in the Cook, Austral, Mangareva, and Marquesas Islands of central Polynesia are in progress, as is 14C dating of selected 230Th-dated corals to determine &Delta;-R marine reservoir values.  The project has provided in-depth training in state-of-the art techniques of isotope geochemistry and mass spectrometry to Dr. Elizabeth Niespolo while she was a graduate student at UC Berkeley.  Early career scientists trained at the Berkeley Geochronology Center, as Dr. Elizabeth Niespolo has been as part of this project, have gone on to career positions working in the U.S. National Labs and at the U.S. Geological Survey, where they apply their skills to problems in national security, energy research, and mitigation of natural hazards.  Dr. Niespolo has accepted a tenure-track position at Princeton University where she plans to establish teaching and research programs in geochemistry and geochronology that will further increase US capability and capacity in these important areas.
