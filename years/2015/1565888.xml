<AbstractNarration>Klaus Ruedenberg and Mark Gordon of Iowa State University are supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division to continue the development of a rigorous and widely applicable method for understanding the chemical bonding that occurs in molecules and molecular systems.  This bonding analysis quantitatively identifies and sorts out the different types of physical interactions that act together in creating bonds between atoms in molecules. As yet, a rigorous understanding does not exist for this fundamental phenomenon in chemistry. While the discovery of 'bonds' goes back two hundred years, it was only a hundred years later that that the simplest chemical bond, in the hydrogen molecule, could be quantitatively calculated on the basis of quantum mechanics. As a result of the recent development of computers, energies of many molecules can now be calculated quite accurately. However, the physical origins of the vast diversity of chemical bonds are still elusive. For instance, only speculations exist on why the carbon monoxide molecule has a stronger bond than the nitrogen molecule even though these simple molecules have very similar electronic structures. In the present analysis, a rigorous quantitative understanding of bond energies in terms of relevant and familiar physical interactions is developed by extracting this information from theoretical calculations. The analysis provides a more reliable guide for intuitive use by practicing chemists in understanding and anticipating bonding patterns than current qualitative rationalizations. The analysis is also provides sound material for teaching the physical origin of chemical binding based on a solid theoretical basis. The goal of the project is to enhance the impact of rigorous quantum mechanical calculations on practical chemistry.  The bonding analysis is included in the freely available and widely used GAMESS (General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System) program suite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the molecular electronic ab initio wave function, orbitals are deduced that have very large overlap with atomic orbitals of the free atoms and, at the same time, are adapted to the bonding pattern in the molecule. The wave function is expressed in terms of these quasi-atomic orbitals and it, thereby, becomes a sum of three terms. The first term embodies the juxtaposed atoms in their valence states without electron migration between them and, hence, without covalent bonding interactions. The second term embodies electron sharing, and hence, covalent bonding between the neutral atoms. The third term embodies charge transfers between the atoms. From this resolution of the wave function, a decomposition of the energy is obtained in terms of five additive contributions that represent the following interactions: formation of the atomic valence states, quasi-classical Coulombic interactions, interference interactions, sharing-penetration interactions, and charge transfer interactions. These interactions are furthermore resolved into contributions of the various orbitals. On the basis of these resolutions, the bonds that link various atoms in specific molecules are characterized and compared.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All matter consists of atoms held together by chemical bonds. The origin of bonds is thus a scientific subject of fundamental importance. The bonding phenomenon is governed by quantum mechanics. Modern computational capabilities have enabled the calculation of quantum mechanical wave functions from which bond energies of useful quantitative accuracy have been predicted for many chemically interesting systems.  However, beyond the raw energy values, key insights into the physical synergism that creates bonds are needed (i) for theoretical in-depth analyses that sort out the interplay of the relevant bond forming interactions under various conditions, and (ii) for generating a coherent web of concepts through which practicing chemists can interpret rigorous calculations and conceptually organize the multitude of bonds within a unified framework.  These physical synergisms are manifestly embedded in the molecular electronic wave function.  The extraction of this information from the wave function has however proved to be difficult. Particularly challenging is the determination of the relevant properties, notably energies, of the constituent atoms in a molecule, which differ from the free atoms. Conventional discussions have not attempted to seek this information in the molecular wave function. Instead, they formulate separate, intuitively biased model wave functions and postulate differences between their energies to be approximations to various expected physical interactions.    By contrast, the present work has taken on and followed through with the task of quantitatively identifying the modified atoms and the interatomic bonding synergism that are inherent in the actual molecular wave function, without using additional, intuitively conceived, but nonetheless arbitrary, independent model wave functions.   A crucial step in achieving this goal has been the successful development of a transformation of the actual wave function into a form that separates and exhibits the intra-atomic energies and the interatomic interactions. On this basis, the modifications of the free atoms and the interatomic interactions were analyzed and sorted out. The resulting resolution of the global molecular binding energy in terms of conceptually interpretable contributions was implemented by a computational code, which was included in the GAMESS program suite.              The generation of covalent bonds is driven by specific terms in the energy resolution which result from the sharing of valence electrons between atoms and lower the kinetic energy. These kinetic bond orders (KBOs) between bonding orbitals of different atoms are relatively simple to calculate. The global set of all KBOs characterizes the bond structure of a molecule.              The systems chosen for the initial applications were selected in order to exhibit the breadth of the analysis. Molecules with various shapes, sizes and bond types were considered. Aside from recovering the understanding of standard bond situations, the analysis was shown to elucidate unusual bond patterns that posed challenges to conventional interpretations.   The analysis has shown that C2 has a quadruple bond because the 2sigmau orbital is in fact bonding.   The remarkable and previously unexplained structural difference between the linear C2H2 and the dibridged valence-iso-electronic Si2H2 was shown to be due to the fact that the two molecules differ in the competition between the intra- and inter-atomic energy changes.              The analysis of the poorly understood bond structure of NO2 has shown the existence of a 3-center 4-electron p-bond and a 3-center 5-electron &sigma;-bond, both created by contragradient charge donations from the N and O lone pair orbitals.  The controversy regarding the bonding of noble gas molecules in HXeCCH, HXeCCXeH, and HXeOXeH was resolved. The sigma-type orbital of Xe donates parts of its two electrons to H and Y (Y=C&amp;O) and thereby generates electron sharing that creates 3-three-center 4-electron covalent bonds. Electrostatic interactions play no part.  The KBO analysis has definitively shown that, when forming bonds, transition metals use the np orbitals, which are vacant in the ground states of the free atoms.              For instance, in CuO, CuCl, ScF and NiSi, bonding is enhanced by electron donation from the ligand to the empty metal 4p orbital and by bond hybridization.  The analysis of the cation (C5H5)2Zr[N(SiHMe2)2]}+ has sorted out the global bond structure among the over 50 bonds between the 43 atoms. Using the 5p orbitals, Zr forms 9 bonds: three to each (C5H5) group, one to N and, in addition, two covalent 3-center 2-electron Zr-H-Si bonds, the controversial pyragostic bonds, which had challenged previous interpretations.              The analysis procedure has been extended for use with atoms in the relativistic regime.  In rhodium monoboride, RhB, the extended analysis, reveals a quadruple bond for the ground state but triple bonds for the lower excited states.  The analyses have shown that the triple bond in CeO, is formed using the Ce-5d orbitals, somewhat polarized by the 4f orbitals whereas, in CeO2, the triple bonds to each O are formed by substantially hybridized Ce-5d-4f orbitals. Electron donation from the oxygen lone pairs to vacant Ce-6s-6p hybrid orbitals creates weak fourth bonds.              Analyses of additional novel molecules continue.
