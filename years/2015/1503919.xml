<AbstractNarration>Providing undergraduate chemistry students with opportunities to acquire effective science communication skills is an important component of science education for the twenty-first century.  Scientists encounter a variety of audiences with which they must communicate, including peer disciplinary experts, scientists from disciplines other than their own and the general public audience.  Current research in the field of science communication identifies several types of methods by which the interchange of information occurs and suggests that broadening the exchange of ideas between experts and the public is a valuable pursuit.  Yet undergraduate science programs rarely include meaningful opportunities for students to learn how to communicate highly technical information to others, especially to non-scientific members of the public.  This project will provide robust education in science communication by incorporating innovative activities throughout the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Wabash College.  For students majoring in chemistry, the activities will include communicating laboratory results in a clear and effectual manner, translating scientific data for a general audience and encouraging broad discussion of science-related news items, innovations and public policy issues.  For non-major chemistry students, activities will be designed to demonstrate how to incorporate scientific evidence into public decision-making about issues such as energy policy and the use of genetically modified organisms.  Integrating effective communication skills into the science curriculum has the potential to impact how educators think about science education, preparing students for the challenges they will face after graduation.  As they enter the workforce, regardless of their career path, science graduates will be required to communicate scientific principles, concepts and results to clients, patients, members of teams of collaborators, investors and many more audiences. In the public sphere, they will be faced with countless conversations with non-scientists about policies related to science and technology, issues of health and safety and actions that affect society as a whole.  This interdisciplinary science communication approach of this project spans the entire chemistry curriculum and will develop valuable skills in students to create well-rounded citizen-scientists who can competently serve as leaders for their communities and their governments in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching focus of the project is to build capacity in students and their professors to create learning environments that will ultimately empower students to understand, interpret and explain complex scientific matters competently, which will ultimately facilitate effective communication with both scientific peers and the general public. The primary goals of this project are: (1) to develop innovative curriculum-based modules that cultivate science communication skills in Wabash College Chemistry majors and minors; (2) to increase the abilities of non-science majors to understand the importance of scientific research and evidence in personal and public decision making; and (3) to encourage faculty development in science communication education.  Project activities will include providing students early in the curriculum with exposure to the language of chemical research. More advanced undergraduates will engage in translational science communication activities, public presentations of scientific news items and will receive guidance via evaluation of oral communication through senior comprehensive examinations.  Faculty professional development will be achieved through a series of summer workshops for Wabash College Chemistry faculty and chemistry faculty members from a diverse group of other institutions, including two-year colleges.  Additionally, materials and outcomes generated by the project will be disseminated through conferences and workshops to encourage and equip other faculty to integrate science communication into their curricula.  To evaluate the activities, the project will use pre- and post-surveys that incorporate quantitative and qualitative measures to assess items such as self-reported learning gains and the ways students and/or faculty conceptualize science communication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Students enrolled in undergraduate Chemistry courses have always been expected to master technical communication of chemical concepts, but successful scientists will also need to translate their technical results to different audiences, including collaborators, investors, granting agencies, and the general public. Likewise, it is critical for the public to connect scientific knowledge to problem solving when dealing with complex technological issues facing society.  To build the bridge between scientists and publics, we have developed and implemented several activities in the Wabash College Chemistry Department centered around innovation in civic engagement and translational science communication.   The activities for this grant took place at Wabash College, a small liberal arts college for men, in Crawfordsville, Indiana.  The activities involved students in the Chemistry Department, students participating in a civic engagement and productive communication initiative, Wabash Democracy and Public Discourse, as well as students in the Biology Department.  Our primary goal was to develop innovative modules to instill and promote effective communication strategies among chemistry majors at Wabash College to help them interpret complex scientific concepts for a variety of audiences.  We focused on modules to prioritize the goal of incorporating science communication into the chemistry curriculum, utilizing professional development opportunities for Chemistry faculty as well as partnerships between the departments of Chemistry, Rhetoric, and English.  A secondary goal was to encourage non-science majors to utilize scientific evidence in public decision-making processes.  The activities that were developed focused on written and oral communication skills and promoted discussion of the broader impact of science in our community and in public policy.  Early efforts incorporated deliberation modules in the non-majors chemistry course and the general chemistry course for science majors. After the introduction of foundational chemical concepts, deliberations focused on socioscientific issues like energy policy, water quality, the environmental impact of industry, and the use of plastics.  Survey assessment indicates that in the non-majors course, students report a greater understanding of how chemistry relates to their life, an increase in knowledge in the area covered, and significant confidence gains in their knowledge.  In our courses for chemistry majors, a wide variety of activities have been incorporated, utilizing opportunities in laboratory write-ups, oral laboratory reports, classroom projects, and literature review to focus on developing translational communication of technical information. Assessment of individual projects ranged from assignments to student surveys to focus groups to questions on comprehensive examinations before graduation. Faculty development within the Chemistry Department has been enhanced through a faculty workshop about science communication, which enabled a conversation about forms of science communication that are critical for our majors to obtain and ways to achieve those goals.   Additionally, one program developed specifically for science-interested students early in their careers is called Speaking Science.  Speaking Science is a four-day summer program for incoming first year students that provides a glimpse into the undergraduate research experience while emphasizing critical translational communication strategies.  It utilizes faculty mentoring as well as peer mentoring in a research environment and culminates in a poster session for the general public.  A focus group with past participants suggests this early intervention with an emphasis on the connection between research and communication prepares them well for their college experiences.  Furthermore, students involved with Speaking Science have taken part in future science research internships as well as with Wabash Democracy and Public Discourse's science communication projects.  As an example, two Speaking Science students co-led the development of two new deliberation activities in the non-majors chemistry course in Fall 2018, bringing the total science communication activities in that course to three modules.  We also provided public outreach activities that brought scientific topics to the broader community of Wabash College through major events, like a podcast recording on campus of "You're the Expert," and through smaller annual events like the "Year in Science" seminar, which featured science faculty sharing new innovations from their fields to a general audience of liberal arts students and faculty.  The emphasis on public access to technical and cutting edge scientific topics serves to create a culture that welcomes and involves scientists and nonscientists alike.
