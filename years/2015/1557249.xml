<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, the "Strategies to Increase the Size, Efficacy, and Retention of the Math and Science Teaching Workforce in High-Need Minnesota Districts" project will recruit undergraduate majors in mathematics, biology and chemistry and prepare them to become grade 7-12 mathematics and science teachers. The project will fund 34 scholarships over 5 years. In this project, College of Saint Scholastica will collaborate with partners, including Duluth Public Schools, Proctor Public Schools, Lake Superior College, Duluth Children's Museum, and the Great Lakes Aquarium. This project will advance knowledge and understanding of the impact of implementing innovative strategies designed to increase the size, efficacy, and retention of the mathematics and science teaching workforce in high-need Minnesota districts. Early recruitment efforts undertaken by The College of Saint Scholastica, in collaboration with partner institutions, will be aimed at increasing recruitment of populations that are underserved or underrepresented in teaching and in STEM disciplines. Scholarships and targeted activities will be implemented to support students through teacher education program requirements, applying for licensure, and securing mathematics and science teaching positions in high-need Minnesota schools. In order to promote retention in STEM teaching workforce, the College of Saint Scholastica education faculty will pair new graduates with experienced mathematics and science mentor teachers in high-need schools and will actively support mandatory induction activities for at least one full academic year after graduation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will provide comprehensive services for prospective mathematics and science teacher candidates and Noyce Scholars, with special emphasis on attracting and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups. Project objectives include: 1) Increase the number of mathematics and science teachers for high-need schools through recruitment and support of 34 Noyce Scholars; 2) Enhance prospective teacher candidates' interest in mathematics and science teaching with assistance from local partners; 3) Promote retention of newly-graduated Noyce Scholars in their early teaching years by providing mandatory induction support, pairing new graduates with mathematics and science teacher mentors; and 4) Increase the knowledge and understanding of the outcomes and challenges in recruiting mathematics and science teachers and of implementing induction supports promoted in the Minnesota Educator Induction guidelines. The project will employ research-based strategies to increase recruitment of talented and underrepresented teacher candidates, help improve pedagogy and knowledge-building, and promote retention of new mathematics and science teachers. Throughout the project, multiple types of qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for program improvement and for advancement of knowledge regarding effective strategies to increase the size, efficacy, and retention of the math and science teaching workforce in high-need schools.</AbstractNarration>
