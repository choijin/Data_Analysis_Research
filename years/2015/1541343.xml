<AbstractNarration>Bucks County Community College (Bucks) is creating a high-throughput science research network to support Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) faculty and students.  This cyber infrastructure (CI) upgrade will coincide with their construction of a new STEM building and future renovation of the current STEM facilities at Newtown (main) campus. This initiative upgrades Bucks CI to support research with a science DMZ to prioritize data transfers among systems located at Bucks, offers an outdoor high performance Wi-Fi network as a science DMZ extension, and provides Internet2 to support faculty and student research through the statewide education network.  The dedicated, advanced network allows for the speeds, packet integrity, and lack of interference from competing applications for research-based data transfer, enabling the faculty and their students to conduct their activities. Bucks' lead institution partner, the University of Pennsylvania, is aiding with design and technical services to ensure the science DMZ meets current and future needs and is sustainable by Bucks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This next-generation infrastructure establishes a dedicated network and provides data transfer services to support broader scientific research and applications. This benefits projects investigating improved forms of image recognition, applied engineering, and other computational sciences. With the bounty of research at the University of Pennsylvania, faculty and students at Bucks have access to scientific domains at a level not previously available, extending our intellectual opportunities. Additionally, with advanced manufacturing, nursing and other science-related activity in the county and surrounding area, the science DMZ indirectly benefits the people, educational institutions, and businesses of the region.</AbstractNarration>

Finally, BUCKS&rsquo; STEM Department hosted an &ldquo;Eclipse Party&rdquo; for the community on 8/21/17.&nbsp; Drawing over 1500 people with 500 users on our Outdoor Wi-Fi network and live streaming from NASA in Science Center classrooms, this extraordinary event was experienced collectively with the community at large.</p> <p>In addition to the specific uses previously mentioned, <strong>the broader impacts</strong> will be significant. By providing a dedicated network with Internet2 access, faculty members and students are now able to gain access to researchers at other institutions for collaboration as well as connections to instrumentation and high-performance systems that enable faculty to use educational and research applications heretofore impossible and thus never considered. Doing so has been and will continue to provide a more robust STEM environment for our students, giving them learning opportunities previously unavailable.&nbsp; As a result, this will enable them to reach their academic goals and potentially transfer to a baccalaureate institution of higher education, as well as be more likely to gain a career that maximizes their potential as an individual and a citizen.&nbsp; Over 50,000 jobs are currently available for STEM graduates (selected industries) in our five county region which is 10% above the national average, and will expand another 12% in the next five years&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Bucks County, the projections show an increase of 15% in STEM related jobs; other occupation report projections show that increases will be strong in the growth of jobs requiring highly skilled individuals,&nbsp; particularly in the occupation groups of Life Scientists, Mathematicians, Information Security Analysts, and Applied Engineering Technicians among others (<a href="http://www.economicmodeling.com/">www.economicmodeling.com</a>).&nbsp; Thus, with advanced manufacturing, nursing and other science-related activity in our region, this network is directly and indirectly benefiting not only our community college and its students, but also the people, educational &amp; health institutions, and businesses in the surrounding region.&nbsp; Additionally, BUCKS currently serves as a co-location facility for KINBER and a regional college, and has the capacity to offer our upgraded infrastructure for the benefit of the region.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/25/2017<br>      Modified by: Ron&nbsp;L&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541343/1541343_10392373_1508782478476_EclipsePartyCrowdandScienceCenter--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541343/1541343_10392373_1508782478476_EclipsePartyCrowdandScienceCenter--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Solar Eclipse Party August 21, 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541343/1541343_10392373_1508782478476_EclipsePartyCrowdandScienceCenter--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Solar Eclipse Party August 21, 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bucks County Community College hosted an "Eclipse Party," with over 1500 people and 500 users on our new Outdoor High Performance Wi-Fi and live streaming of NASA in our Science Center classrooms--all made possible by this NSF CC*DNI grant and cyber infrastructure upgrade.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ron Smith</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ron&nbsp;L&nbsp;Smith</div> <div class="imageTitle">Solar Eclipse Party August 21, 2017</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541343/1541343_10392373_1508782169100_EclipseoverBUCKS--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541343/1541343_10392373_1508782169100_EclipseoverBUCKS--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Eclipse over Bucks County Community College"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541343/1541343_10392373_1508782169100_EclipseoverBUCKS--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Eclipse over Bucks County Community College"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of Solar Eclipse from Bucks County Community College on August 21, 2017/</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ron Smith</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ron&nbsp;L&nbsp;Smith</div> <div class="imageTitle">Eclipse over Bucks County Community College</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541343/1541343_10392373_1508947080308_PICTUREOFCAMPUSFROMQUADROTOR--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541343/1541343_10392373_1508947080308_PICTUREOFCAMPUSFROMQUADROTOR--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Quadrotor Flying over Campus"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541343/1541343_10392373_1508947080308_PICTUREOFCAMPUSFROMQUADROTOR--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Quadrotor Flying over Campus"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Engineering Students fly the Quadrotor they built over the Bucks County Community College Campus.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  "Energizing the Future of STEM@Bucks"  Grant Period:   91//15-8/31/17  Funds from our NSF CC*DNI Grant, Energizing the Future of STEM@Bucks, Award ID# 1541343 have allowed Bucks County Community College (BUCKS) to develop a high-throughput science research network.  This cyber infrastructure upgrade has been in conjunction with the construction of our new Science Center and renovation of the current STEM facilities at our Newtown (main) campus.  Through this grant, we have (1) designed and built a Science DMZ in the Science Center to prioritize data transfers between systems located at BUCKS (2) developed and installed an Outdoor High Performance Wi-Fi network as an extension of the Science DMZ and (3) accessed systems on Internet2 to support faculty and student research.  Our institutional partners, University of Pennsylvania and KINBER aided in the design and provided technical services to ensure the BUCKS network meets current and future needs and is sustainable by the College.   The intellectual merit of this effort has been manifested in the increased number of faculty-student research projects using the upgraded cyber infrastructure to collect and share data using the dedicated Science DMZ and Internet2 connection, as well as the installation of an Outdoor High Performance Wi-Fi network.  As a result, our STEM curriculum and student learning is now grounded more broadly in research as a means of reinforcing active learning.  Examples during the grant period include (but are not limited to):  Quadrotor aerial data collection, Monarch Habitat Restoration Project (engaging math, statistics, computer science, biology, environmental science and other disciplines from STEM), and an upcoming student research study of primary productivity in a local freshwater lake ecosystem.  These projects all involve utilizing the College?s upgraded network, including sharing data with other universities.  STEM students have presented their research projects at the College?s Student Research Conference (December and April), a forum to disseminate findings and an outlet to pursue their intellectual passions.  The success of this cyber infrastructure upgrade also shows us that a science-based research and education network is key in recruiting and retaining STEM faculty who are interested in conducting research that will require such networking infrastructure.  We can now provide faculty and students with opportunities to connect with other institutions to share and be exposed to research, as well as to conduct local research with this infrastructure which was not possible before this upgrade. Finally, BUCKS? STEM Department hosted an "Eclipse Party" for the community on 8/21/17.  Drawing over 1500 people with 500 users on our Outdoor Wi-Fi network and live streaming from NASA in Science Center classrooms, this extraordinary event was experienced collectively with the community at large.  In addition to the specific uses previously mentioned, the broader impacts will be significant. By providing a dedicated network with Internet2 access, faculty members and students are now able to gain access to researchers at other institutions for collaboration as well as connections to instrumentation and high-performance systems that enable faculty to use educational and research applications heretofore impossible and thus never considered. Doing so has been and will continue to provide a more robust STEM environment for our students, giving them learning opportunities previously unavailable.  As a result, this will enable them to reach their academic goals and potentially transfer to a baccalaureate institution of higher education, as well as be more likely to gain a career that maximizes their potential as an individual and a citizen.  Over 50,000 jobs are currently available for STEM graduates (selected industries) in our five county region which is 10% above the national average, and will expand another 12% in the next five years    In Bucks County, the projections show an increase of 15% in STEM related jobs; other occupation report projections show that increases will be strong in the growth of jobs requiring highly skilled individuals,  particularly in the occupation groups of Life Scientists, Mathematicians, Information Security Analysts, and Applied Engineering Technicians among others (www.economicmodeling.com).  Thus, with advanced manufacturing, nursing and other science-related activity in our region, this network is directly and indirectly benefiting not only our community college and its students, but also the people, educational &amp; health institutions, and businesses in the surrounding region.  Additionally, BUCKS currently serves as a co-location facility for KINBER and a regional college, and has the capacity to offer our upgraded infrastructure for the benefit of the region.
