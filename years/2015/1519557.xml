<AbstractNarration>Uncertainty in the timing of major storm events in the Atlantic Ocean, some of which have devastating impacts on infrastructure along the east coast of the United States, is a major hindrance in our ability to adequately understand, plan, and possibly mitigate the negative effects of future major storm events especially now that the ocean is documented to be warming and sea level along the east coast is documented to be rising.  Much of what we know about the prehistoric record of ocean storm events, like hurricanes or like Super Storm Sandy, come from the sedimentary record in coastal lakes, lagoons, and other places where sediments are transported and deposited.  Due to erosion by subsequent events or the mixing of sediments by organisms that live in coastal regions or in the sediments themselves, sometimes these records are hard to date and read due to disruption of characteristic sedimentary features or chemical indicators, like organic detritus and chemical or physical indicators of the timing of the deposit.  As a result, this research, funded by a RAPID award, seeks to take samples from ponds and submarine caves on the island of Bermuda to examine fresh, unaltered sedimentary deposits left by category 3 Hurricane Gonzalo which struck the island on October 18, 2014 causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.  This award funds the research of two early career faculty members, one from Texas A&amp;M University and one from the University of Southern Mississippi to collect cores of fresh sedimentary material on Bermuda that is related to Hurricane Gonzalo and analyze samples using various isotopes (13C, 7Be, 137Cs) that will allow the determination of the origin of any organic matter and allow the deposits to be accurately dated.  The study will also measure various sediment physical properties (e.g., particle size, weight percent organic matter) and carry out X-ray Fluoresence (XRF) scanning of the cores, which will enable studies of sedimentary structures that indicate the rates and processes of sediment deposition.  Results of the investigation will be compared to older sedimentary records collected by these investigators in the same locations over the past six years. The fresh sediments will be used to help calibrate the older records and help the investigators distinguish between simple storminess records and major hurricane events.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work are significant.  Societal impacts include an improvement of our understanding of the timing and intensity of mid-Atlantic storm and hurricane records, a number of which originate in the tropics; travel north over the ocean; and then curve eastward wreaking major damage on western Europe coastal and inland communities.  The research also has the potential to resolve the disparity of interpretations of prehistoric Bermudian storm records, which are important for understanding tropical hurricane frequency that impacts communities and infrastructure on the US eastern seaboard.  Additional impacts include the funding of two early career scientists, one of whom is at an institution in an EPSCoR state (Mississippi). There will also be training of undergraduate and graduate students, some of whom are from a gender under-represented in the geological science. These students will be engaged in analyzing samples and comparing them with previously collected sedimentary records.  In addition, the lead investigator will organize a local symposium in Bermuda to engage local stakeholders in the research program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the past several years, researchers from Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston (TAMUG) and the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) have been using the sediments in coastal ponds and submarine caves in Bermuda to understand how storm activity in the Sargasso Sea has changed over thousands of years. More specifically, we aimed to diagnose how the climate and ocean system has been driving long-term storm activity in the subtropical North Atlantic. Bermuda is geographically significant because it is the only location where hurricanes re-curving towards Europe may have made landfall and preserved a record of their passage in the sedimentary record. On 18 October 2014, Hurricane Gonzalo struck the islands of Bermuda as an intense hurricane (category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale) and caused between $200 and $400 million US dollars in insured losses. However, the storm provided an opportunity to re-sample and calibrate the sedimentary records from previously examined field sites to a specific hurricane event. The primary research objectives of this RAPID project were to: (i) immediately re-sample our field sites and assess the modern sedimentological impact of Hurricane Gonzalo, (ii) survey the coastline for evidence of impact from Hurricane Gonzalo, and (iii) work collaboratively to disentangle the resultant storminess signals from these two different coastal sedimentary environments. We first rapidly mobilized equipment and personnel, and with the support of our local collaborators (Bermuda Zoological Society; Bermuda Aquarium, Museum, and Zoo; and the Bermuda Caver&rsquo;s Group), we re-sampled previously studied field sites and surveyed the Bermudian coastline in March and August 2015 for evidence of impacts from Hurricane Gonzalo. In August 2015, we presented preliminary results to a local meeting in Bermuda of stakeholders, decision makers, and environmental conservationists of our ongoing research efforts. Back in the laboratory, all new sediment cores were analyzed, and new radiocarbon ages were obtained to date the sediment cores. We also further refined a new method for analyzing coarse-grained sediments that are deposited into coastal ponds, sinkholes and caves on carbonate platforms (termed the Sieve-First LOI method). This new sedimentary method allows for the direct comparison of coarse-grained sediments deposited into the submarine cave (Walsingham Cavern) and coastal pond (Mangrove Lake). The results from this project (new methods and data) indicate that Bermuda experienced a period of elevated intense hurricane activity from 1000 CE to present, which is critical new information towards furthering our knowledge of paleo hurricane activity in the North Atlantic. These results will be a valuable contribution to many scientists working to understand the oceanic and atmospheric drivers of North Atlantic hurricane activity through both observational and modeling methods. In 2015, this project produced: 4 conference proceedings, contributed to 1 published paper in an international peer-reviewed journal (more are pending), and field and laboratory training for undergraduate and graduate students (2 female, 1 male) at TAMUG and USM.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/07/2016<br>      Modified by: Peter&nbsp;Van Hengstum</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1519557/1519557_10346337_1460055827439_Figure2DataComparion--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1519557/1519557_10346337_14600558...]]></DRECONTENT>
