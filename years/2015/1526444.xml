<AbstractNarration>Dust particles in the atmosphere are known to affect weather and climate through the absorption and scattering of radiation and through their ability to affect cloud processes.  In order to better understand the variability of dust loading in the atmosphere it is important to study how dust aerosols are transported from the surface to the atmosphere, a process known as saltation.  This award will provide funding for observations and analysis of data from the Owens Lake playa in California, a dry lake bed that is known as a significant source of dust pollution.  The research will seek to determine the roles of soil particle size distribution, crusted soil, water content, and dust electrification in saltation.  The long-term societal benefits of the project are through better representation of dust in the weather and climate system, thereby improving forecasts.  In the shorter-term the researchers will work with the Owens Valley air quality officer, offering a direct link to health effects, and the project will also contribute to the education and training of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will investigate the effects of soil composition, particle size distribution, and soil water content on the depth of the saltation layer, the intensity of saltation, the electric fields generated by saltation, and the PM2.5 aerosol concentration as a function of wind shear stress in a variety of weather phenomena and climate conditions.  The campaign is primarily observational, with instrumentation residing in the Owens Lake salty playa in California.  The three main objectives of the work are in the following areas:  1) Saltation and dust lifting - Continued and improved measurements will be used to test competing hypotheses about the correlation between vertical dust flux and near surface humidity, 2) Effects of electric fields on dust lifting - Electric field data would be used to test the hypothesis that electric forces attract saltating particles toward the surface, inhibiting increases in the depth of the saltation layer with increases in wind shear stress at the surface, and 3)  Dusty weather phenomena - The researcher will study the intensity and depth of the saltation layer and dust lifting in weather phenomena ranging from small-scale dusty plumes and vortices to larger-scale dust storms to accurately quantify the contributions from each to the dust cycle.  The hypothesis that dust lifted by convective events is much richer in fine particles will also be tested.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Mineral dust emission is second only to sea salt in their contribution to the global aerosol budget. Mineral dust particles are lifted from the surface mainly by saltation, a process by which sand particles forced to move by the wind skip along the surface, ejecting the smaller, harder to lift, dust particles (aerosols) into the air (Bagnold, 1941). Thus, a good understanding of saltation is essential for improving our understanding of the aerosol budget and its variability.  We developed an instrument suite to measure saltation and dust lifting during multiple seasons and a variety of weather conditions.  The instrument suite includes a patent protected electric field sensor developed with funding from NSF.  This sensor is unique because it is capable of measuring both DC and AC electric fields accurately even when the sensor is subject to the impact of charged particles. The major goal of the University of Michigan Characterization of the Effects of a Severe Drought on Dust Lifting (Short Title: Aerosols-Clouds Interactions &ndash;ACI) project is to understand the effects of California’s current severe draught on this process. In order to achieve this goal, we have been conducting field measurements at a site in the Owens Lake salty playa in California since December 2012 (Fig. 1). The Owens Lake is one of the largest sources of dust in US (Gillette et al., 1997a; Gillette et al., 1997b; Halleaux, 2013; Halleaux and Renno, 2014). In 1998 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandated that the LADWP take steps to reduce dust concentration in Owens Lake area because the concentration had been exceeding the federal air safety standards by two orders of magnitude. The LADWP current dust mitigation efforts include gravel covering, sand fencing, plowing, managed vegetation, buried drip tubing, and shallow-flooding of the lakebed (Figs. 2-5). A key outcome of our project was the discoverythat strong saltation events trigger an abrupt order of magnitude increase in the PM2.5 aerosol concentration when the soil volumetric water content starts to decrease from its peak seasonal value (Fig. 6). The PM2.5 aerosol concentration returns to low values only after the volumetric soil water content returns to its peak seasonal value. During droughts, the period of low soil volumetric water content and elevated PM2.5 aerosol concentration starts earlier in the year, and lasts longer than during regular non-drought seasons. The discovery of the abrupt order of magnitude increase in PM2.5 aerosol concentration when the soil volumetric water content starts to decrease from its peak seasonal value has important implications for our understand of climate processes because during droughts, the period of low soil volumetric water content and elevated PM2.5 aerosol concentration starts earlier in the year, and lasts longer than during regular non-drought seasons. We found that since the recent severe drought started in California, the periods of high aerosol concentration have been getting longer, year after year, ranging from 4 months in 2013 to about 10 months in 2015-2016 when the drought peaked (Fig. 6).  In 2017 the dust concentration remained extremely low until June, but this could have been at least in part due to dust mitigation efforts by the LADWP in mid-March. In July 2017 the PM2.5 concentration started to exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) again.  From mid-December 2017 until June 2018 the PM2.5 concentration was extremely high again, exceeding 0.3 mg/m3, in spite of large dust mitigation efforts around our site by the LADWP (Fig. 6). We discovered that in spite of tremendous dust mitigation efforts by the city of Los Angeles, the PM2.5 aerosol concentration has been exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality standard at our field site in the Owens Lake area.
