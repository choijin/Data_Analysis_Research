<AbstractNarration>This project's research activities will advance the field of bioinformatics by creating a computational method that combines different types of information from genome-wide association studies. Genetic association studies measure sequence differences across an entire genome in order to identify what variants cause the occurrence and variability of traits like height and disease susceptibility. The goal of this project is to develop methods to precisely locate gene regulatory variants, that now are only known to be somewhere in a large region, and use them to understand how traits vary in a population. The methods developed in this research aim to combine a number of types of information, like gene expression levels for cells, measurement of traits in many individuals, and comparisons with traits in other species, in order to identify causal regulatory variants. The project's curriculum development activities will contribute to STEM education by creating and sharing a hands-on workshop on genome bioinformatics in the research area. By integrating research and educational activities students will (i) gain science literacy in the areas of genetics and bioinformatics;  (ii) show how well hands-on methods work in genetics education; and (iii) use already performed genetic association studies to gain new knowledge in biology and in biomedicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will create and evaluate an integrative machine-learning model for identifying regulatory variants within human intergenic GWAS regions. The model's inputs will include the reference genome, the local DNA 3-D shape, phylogenetic conservation, and transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements. The model's output will be predicted regulatory variants with significance scores. The model will be benchmarked against published methods using ground-truth regulatory variants. The machine-learning model's variant predictions will be incorporated into an open-source, web-based software tool for integrative post-analysis of GWAS data. Compatibility with a cloud-computing framework will position the tool for maximum impact. Through educational activities that are integrated with the project's research activities, Dr. Ramsey will create, evaluate, and disseminate a Genome Bioinformatics Workshop unit for high school educators and students. Participants will learn to use the tool to analyze and explore human GWAS-identified regions for a model trait (height); through this they would be expected to gain a better understanding of the potential of the field of personal genomics. The workshop's materials will be developed within an interdisciplinary workshop incubator consisting of pairs of STEM-underrepresented CS and biology undergraduate summer students. We will create, evaluate, and disseminate the workshop unit in partnership with three outreach programs for STEM-underrepresented students. &lt;br/&gt;Project results will be made available at the project website: lab.saramsey.org/regulome</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) are types of single-base genetic variations (across the population) at specific non-coding locations in the genome, that affect how and under what circumstances and to what extent genes are expressed into functional proteins or RNAs. Most non-coding genetic variation is not functional and it is difficult to distinguish rSNPs from nonfunctional, noncoding genetic variants. Nevertheless, most genetic regions identified as trait-associated in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are noncoding, and thus, pinpointing potential rSNPs within these regions is important in order to mechanistically understand how genetics influences complex (multiple-gene) whole-organism traits in higher organisms. Experimentally finding rSNPs is difficult and time-consuming, and thus, computer-based methods that can identify potential rSNPs are an important tool for maximizing the knowledge dividend from GWAS. In this project, we created a new and improved machine-learning method for identifying rSNPs, called CERENKOV. CERENKOV outperformed (in terms of accuracy) every other computational method for identifying rSNPs that we compared it to; this state-of-the-art performance is due to several unique innovations that we incorporated into CERENKOV, including molecular network information and data-space geometry. This work crosses the boundary between advancing applied bioinformatics for population genetics studies as well as advancing knowledge in applied machine-learning. In the latter context (machine-learning), we created a new method for measuring machine-learning performance and a method for minimizing bias in performance measurement, that are both applicable to machine-learning problems in which examples have a "grouped" structure with one or more positive example per group (such as is the case with the rSNP prediction problem). This project provided bioinformatics and computational biology training for students at multiple career stages including high school students (recruited for internships in our lab via the Portland-based Saturday Academy's Apprenticeships in Science &amp; Engineering program), undergraduate students (recruited through the Office of Women and Minorities in Engineering program at Oregon State University), and graduate students. Our work on the project has been published in multiple peer-reviewed venues including BMC Bioinformatics, the proceedings of the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, the proceedings of the ACM conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics, and Methods in Molecular Biology. We disseminated our work on the project and our findings via presentations at the aforementioned national meetings as well as at multiple regional professional meetings. Further, we have hosted on GitHub (under an open-source software license) all of the software code that we wrote for the project, including software code for generating rSNP prediction scores for all SNPs genome-wide. Our research work on the project stimulated and enriched our curriculum development work on the project, in which we created four K-12 STEM activities in the area of genetics, in collaboration with the OSU Science &amp; Mathematics Investigative Learning Experience (SMILE) program. We tested and evaluated the activities at five SMILE-sponsored teacher workshops and provided activity kits and teacher resource modules to SMILE for dissemination to partner schools throughout Oregon.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Stephen&nbsp;A&nbsp;Ramsey</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
