<AbstractNarration>Cyber criminals are pushing Internet security and cybercrime prevention strategies to the limit. As attacks become more sophisticated, defenses must stay one step ahead. A cybersecurity workforce with an abundance of skilled workers is a key component of these defenses. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to produce cybersecurity workers equipped with the knowledge and skills to produce the next-generation defenses. Felician College has a rich source of students that includes underrepresented racial and ethnic minority students, women, non-traditional adults, and former military personnel. These populations will bring unique perspectives and experiences to the cybersecurity field, which are currently lacking. As a small private institution, Felician can also pilot cutting-edge cybersecurity educational programs and develop cyber security-specific pedagogical methods that work with small-school infrastructures. This knowledge has the potential to change the cybersecurity landscape nationally by extending opportunities to the many students who attend smaller colleges and universities willing to offer innovative programs in computer science and cybersecurity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of this project are designed to promote improvement in cybersecurity education and workforce development. Specifically, successful implementation of this program will allow Felician to apply for status as a Center for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense. To accomplish this goal, infrastructure and coursework will be improved through three specific aims: (1) Re-design existing and develop new coursework for the Bachelor of Science in cybersecurity; (2) Build a specialized computer laboratory for use by the undergraduate and graduate programs; (3) Develop a cybersecurity track within the Master Degree in Computer Science. Through these activities, two new undergraduate courses will be developed, seven existing courses will be mapped to required knowledge units, and six new graduate-level cybersecurity courses will be developed. All new and re-designed coursework will be developed in accordance with guidelines provided by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Rigorous formative and summative evaluation of course content and student learning outcomes will ensure programmatic success.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes Report for NSF Cyber Corps Grant Award #1516092 at FelicianUniversity in Lodi, New Jersey:  This report capsulizes the work that has been done over these past three years, as made possible by the grant.  The grant has enabled us to upgrade and make necessary modifications to our Cybersecurity undergraduate degree, open a brand-new Cybersecurity computer lab and supply it with necessary equipment that includes a virtual lab configuration, share our offerings with high schools and other colleges, create a new joint degree with the Criminal Justice Department,  engage in the process of becoming a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (which is on-going), engage in curriculum development that has generated a host of new courses in Cybersecurity, and initialize a Master's Track in Cybersecurity within the Master of Science in Computer Science graduate degree.  For all of these accomplishments over the past three years, we are indebted to the National Science Foundation for providing the funds.    Summary of the aims and accomplishments:  1.  Creation of new and modification of existing undergraduate Cybersecurity degree courses are all now mapped to NSA/DHS-designated knowledge units.  Among the new undergraduate courses is a course in Scripting Languages and Applications as well as one in Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing.  Among the existing courses that were modified to include designated coverage of security-related content are courses such as Database Management Systems and Data Structures and Algorithms.  The knowledge units mapping matrix along with updated course descriptions, sample syllabi, and screen shots were provided in the Annual Project Report for Year 1 (2015-2016).    2.  The building of a computer lab designated for cybersecurity has taken place.  It began with the search for an appropriate space on campus to construct such a laboratory.  Once a location was determined, the construction process included clearing out the former Archives facility, creating a model for a state-of-the-art cybersecurity lab, and then supplying the space with all new wiring and cabling, lab furniture, equipment, smart board, and white boards.  The lab has been configured to allow students to engage in penetration testing, hacking, and other cyber activities in a virtual environment, separate from the University's campus-wide network.  This will allow students to engage in hacking that will not endanger any other active networks or systems on campus, and will minimize maintenance by the IT staff concerning this location. The model sketches and floor plan for this laboratory were included in the Annual Project Report for Year 1.  3.  Under the auspices of the grant, the Computer Science Department has collaborated with the Criminal Justice Department to develop an interdisciplinary degree in Cybersecurity and Criminal Justice.  This new degree benefits undergraduate students in Cybersecurity by giving them a more complete picture of cybercrime and how it is handled in the criminal justice system. The degree greatly enhances the Criminal Justice student's knowledge concerning such things as digital forensics and encryption. The program is built on a solid Computer Science basis, so that students in this major will have the necessary technical background to comprehend with clarity the computer-based aspects of cybercrime.  4.  Another aim of the grant has been to engage in outreach.  This has taken shape in the form of multiple presentations on Cybersecurity given by Felician University faculty at local high schools; collaboration with other departments and schools within Felician University to discuss Cybersecurity and their disciplines; information about our Cybersecurity program offerings made available on our website, as well as through media advertisements and through our Admissions Office contacts and special webinars;  and finally, active communication about our curricula with colleagues at fellow institutions.  The grant has facilitated attendance at several Cybersecurity conferences, netting valuable networking contacts.  There has even been a significant connection brokered with an institution in Ireland.  5.  Pursuit of Felician University status as a Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Cyber Defense is on-going. Creation of the Cybersecurity lab in which can be conducted hacking and penetration testing and even possibly penetration competitions in the future, as well as the curriculum discussions with other colleges, the delivery of presentations at local schools, the establishment of the interdisciplinary degree between Cybersecurity and Criminal Justice, the Cybersecurity credentials of Felician's faculty, and the fact that Felician regularly hosts an ever-expanding cyber camp experience on weekends for young people from surrounding communities are all elements that move us closer to CAE status.   6.  Finally, Felician University has now established a Master's Track in Cybersecurity within our Master of Science in Computer Science degree.  Qualified students who are admitted into the MS in CS program can specialize in Cybersecurity upon completion of the core graduate courses in Computer Science.  The Cybersecurity track includes Advanced Cryptography, Advanced Network Security, Advanced Digital Forensics, and Advanced Penetration Testing &amp; Cyberwarfare, as well as a Capstone Research course in Cybersecurity.
