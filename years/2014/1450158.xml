<AbstractNarration>1450158 - Chin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will identify and develop steps to align the undergraduate and graduate education of chemical engineers with career needs in industry, using a survey, an industry-academia workshop, and analysis and communication of the findings. Chemical engineering's domain of expertise continues to expand as new fields of research arise, but a core of its application is processes for manufacturing. Chemical engineers continue to be leaders in the traditional chemical process industries (CPI), making fuels, chemicals, and polymers, but they also work in foods, microelectronics, pharmaceuticals, and in horizon areas such as nanotechnology. With this ever-expanding scope, the proposed two-day workshop aims to identify potential enhancements to the chemical engineering curriculum that would favorably impact student preparedness for the industrial sector. Prior to the workshop, a formal survey will be conducted to identify industry needs and any gaps that need to be filled in the chemical engineering curricula with respect to those needs. The survey results will be discussed and analyzed at the workshop with an invited group of attendees from academia and industry. The expected outputs of the workshop are a report and recommended course of action on further aligning the chemical engineering curriculum with industry needs. The results of the workshop will be presented at a national AIChE meeting, as well as posted on the AIChE website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The principal intellectual merits of the project are identification of undergraduate and graduate education needed for career success in industry, examination of how faculty expertise and approaches align with these needs, and recommendation of steps to improve this alignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the workshop include improved education for undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty and improved effectiveness of chemical engineering graduates for a diverse range of careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How should chemical engineering graduates be prepared most effectively for their careers? To answer, we must achieve a degree of alignment among the expectations of academic and industrial chemical engineers. These groups can have important differences of opinion about what technical content and professional skills new graduates should have. The professionÆs diverse career directions require that in a deeper sense, we must also align the expectations of what chemical engineering is.  The present study builds on a 2013 AIChE plenary event on "Chemical Engineering Expertise in Academe and as Sought by Industry," chaired by the late John Chen. That event identified an expertise shift in faculty away from research in the traditional process sciences, largely toward activity in fundamental and applied biological sciences.  It left unanswered the question of whether this shift weakens or aids the effectiveness of ChE education for the breadth of industrial careers. Also, academics and industry differ in their perspectives on what parts of ChE education are essential and which are just desirable.  Here, academic and industrial chemical engineers were first surveyed, the latter group divided into senior (B.S. before 2001) and junior cohorts. This survey was analyzed by pooling statisticians and then by the task force who composed this report. It then was further digested and explored in a two-day industrial-academic workshop held March 9 and 10, 2015, at the National Science Foundation. To strengthen this resulting report, it was vetted among a broad set of readers.  Key findings and recommendations of this study build on changes in the technologies of chemical engineering and education, the profession, and its place in the world. Nevertheless, many findings echo longtime issues.  1. The ChE undergraduate core-topic structure (balances, thermodynamics, transport, separations, kinetics, and design) has endured not because it is frozen but because it has adapted dynamically to new ideas, emphases, challenges, and opportunities.     Industrial voices asserted that academics should provide still greater technical breadth of topics. At the same time, depth is necessary in central, foundational topics. Learning biochemical principles now is generally accepted and desired by industry, and it should be well woven into the core structure. New emphasis is particularly needed on process safety, process dynamics, applied process control, and applied statistics through new teaching materials and effective integration into the curriculum. Re-emphasis is needed on actively developing critical-thinking skills; leadership and team-function skills; communications, especially writing; open-ended task analysis and problem solving; and time management. Passively expecting such skills to develop is inadequate. Getting professional experience in co-ops, summer jobs, and international contexts has increased in importance.      2. Terminal masterÆs degrees can add valuable depth, but there were mixed opinions about their benefit vs. cost.  3. PhDs usually transition smoothly into industrial positions when their doctoral research and first job are closely related, but their career development requires breadth.  Pre-graduation professional development would be very valuable for PhDs, whether they enter or interact with industry. PhDs should be better prepared to adapt to industrial work environments and communication styles. Students from non-ChE disciplines entering ChE PhD studies need effective exposure to and strengthening in the breadth of core chemical-engineering topics.   4. Faculty members all bear responsibility to have a sound, sufficiently deep perspective on the core curriculum.     Having some industrial or consulting experience results in faculty members who are better able to give perspectives on application of the core ChE topics. At the same time, faculty attitude is most crucial for framing a topicÆs technological context effectively -- bein...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
