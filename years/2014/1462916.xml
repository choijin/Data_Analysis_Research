<AbstractNarration>Immediate cellular environment, commonly referred to as the extracellular matrix, consists of micro/nanofibers (diameter: microns to sub-100 nanometers) and serves as a scaffold upon which most cells in the body attach and receive mechanical and chemical cues. An increased awareness of the role of alignment in extracellular matrix-cell interactions and the role of biophysical cues in development and disease models including cancer has necessitated the development of fiber manufacturing technologies mimicking the native environments for in vivo translational and in vitro cell behavior studies. Electrospinning is the most commonly used manufacturing method to fabricate nanofibers. However, it still lacks precise control on fiber diameter, spacing and orientation. This award utilizes a non-electrospinning fiber manufacturing platform to architect precise biophysical environments for cell studies through improved spinnability of biopolymers with control on fiber diameter, spacing and orientation in multiple layers. The resulting constructs can be instrumental in developing implantable scaffolds for tissue engineering, and single cell diagnostic platforms. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This multidisciplinary research involves elements from disciplines such as manufacturing, polymer physics, biology, mechanics and mechanical engineering. The award will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering research and positively impact engineering education at both undergraduate and graduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physics of polymer fiber formation at the nanoscale involves a delicate balance between solution rheology and applied external forces, which makes nanomanufacturing and hierarchical assembly of nanofibers extremely challenging. To augment our capabilities in fiber manufacturing, a non-electrospinning nanofiber manufacturing platform will be used to study fiber spinnability in this work. Due to elimination of electric source in the manufacturing process, the platform will provide superior control on fiber diameter, orientation, spacing and assembly, particularly in multiple layers. Using poly (lactic-co-glycolide acid) and fibrinogen as model polymer systems, this project will develop fiber spinnability scaling laws representing fiber diameter design space spanning a wide range of solution rheologies and processing parameters. Furthermore, mechanical tensile testing of single fibers using atomic force microscopy at different strain rates will provide the fiber probability failure Weibull distributions in the manufacturing process. This research will fill the knowledge gap on the spinnability of biopolymers and for the first time provide the ability to manufacture custom architectures representing gradients in biophysical cues. The overall research will thus provide a roadmap to design and build scaffolds of biopolymers with improved quality, scalability and repeatability.</AbstractNarration>

We develop multi-layer fiber networks of a variety of biocompatible (Poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)(PLGA) and Poly-ethylene oxide (PEO)) and biopolymers (Hyaluronic acid (HA), Fibrinogen and Gelatin).

Tensile testing of parallel fiber arrays of tightly controlled diameters at different strain rates quantifies material modulus to be diameter dependent. Modeling the fiber arrays as springs in parallel (6, 10, 14 and 30 fibers), allows us to extend the mechanical characterization to the nanoscale, thus providing a new method to characterize the fragile polymer nanofibers.</span></p> <p><span>Multi-layer nanofibrous architectures were created by depositing fibers of controlled diameters at specific spacing to quantitate cell behavior. Using a parallel network of fibers interfaced with monolayers, we recapitulated the invasion of cells from monolayers in single, chain and collective modes as described in&nbsp;<em><span>in vivo&nbsp;</span></em>literature. We also identified suspended gap closure depended upon both the shape (oval or circle) and size of the gaps, with smaller gaps &lt; 85,000 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;closing independent of shape, while those between 85000-140000 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;closed only for oval gaps, and gaps larger than 140,000 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;did not close for both shapes (<strong><span>Figure 1</span></strong>). We developed crosshatch network of fibers of varied interfiber spacing: (<em><span>dense ~&nbsp;</span></em>3 and 6 &mu;m,&nbsp;<em><span>intermediate ~&nbsp;</span></em>18 and 36 &mu;m, and&nbsp;<em><span>wide ~ 54&nbsp;&mu;</span></em>m) to study migrational and cytoskeletal plasticity (<strong><span>Figure 2</span></strong>). Unexpectedly, we found that cells on&nbsp;<em><span>dense&nbsp;</span></em>networks had elongated shapes and migrated at high speeds persistently similar to cells on anisotropic parallel network of fibers. On&nbsp;<em><span>intermediate&nbsp;</span></em>networks, cells behaved similar to 2D flat substrates, and on&nbsp;<em><span>wide&nbsp;</span></em>networks, cells were observed to be near-stationary in kite shapes.&nbsp;<em><span>Dense&nbsp;</span></em>3 &mu;m networks caused cancer cells to have 3D shapes due to poorly developed f-actin stress fibers and thick nuclei, a signature of invasive potential. To study individual protrusions, we created fiber networks with mismatch of diameters (<em><span>base fiber ~&nbsp;</span></em>2000 nm, and&nbsp;<em><span>protrusive fiber ~</span></em>&nbsp;100, 200 and 600 nm). This design constrained cell migration along the larger&nbsp;<em><span>base&nbsp;</span></em>fibers while allowing cells to form protrusions on&nbsp;<em><span>protrusive&nbsp;</span></em>fibers (<strong><span>Figure 3</span></strong>). To determine if protrusions were formed similarly on flat substrates, we developed a new manufacturing method to deposit flat ribbons of equivalent widths and showed that flat 2D substrates are unable to capture the protrusive sensitivity to round fibers. We also demonstrated a diminished role of intermediate filament vimentin in protrusion dynamics. We extended the diameter mismatch strategy to identify that cells biophysically sensed curvature by&nbsp;<em><span>coiling&nbsp;</span></em>(wrapping-around) on fibers (<strong><span>Figure 4</span></strong>). The&nbsp;<em><span>coiling width&nbsp;</span></em>increased with fiber diameter and interestingly breast cancer cells were found to form wider&nbsp;<em><span>coil widths&nbsp;</span></em>compared to their non-tumorigenic counterparts.</span></p> <p><span>The research strategy and methods developed in this proposal trained multiple graduate students and undergraduate students including minority students in manufacturing, material characterization and use of nanofibers.
