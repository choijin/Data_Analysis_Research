<AbstractNarration>A major part of the National Science Foundation's EarthScope program facility is the Plate Boundary Observatory located along the Pacific coasts of the continental U.S. and Alaska.  74 borehole strainmeters have been installed as part of the Plate Boundary Observatory and collect ground deformation data that pertain to natural earthquake processes along the major fault systems of California, Oregon, and Washington states.  Strain signals recorded by these systems depend on the conditions of the rock that immediately surrounds the borehole at depths of 500 feet or more in addition to the engineering details of how the instrument was cemented into the borehole.  Unlike other geophysical instruments, borehole strainmeters must be calibrated after they have been installed to make sense of the resulting data.  Scientists from the University of Memphis and UNAVCO, the major facilities operator, will be developing a method to calibrate these strainmeters by using seismic signals recorded by seismic instruments that have been installed with nearly all strainmeters.  These methods will be developed for strainmeters within the ANZA seismic network of southern California and will also rely on data collected by two additional seismic array experiments.  One has been installed at the Pinyon Flat Observatory run by the University of California, San Diego and at other by UNAVCO at selected strainmeter sites within the ANZA network.  Calibration of these instruments is an invaluable service to the scientific community but, more importantly, calibrated and co-located seismic and strain instruments allow a new scientific use of this EarthScope facility through recently developed theory of seismic wave propagation.  Each strainmeter/seismic instrument combination can take the place of a large specialized array of seismic instruments to determine the direction and speed of seismic waves generated by local earthquakes.  This can allow a network of borehole strainmeters to be used as a network of seismic arrays to quickly locate and characterize an ongoing large earthquake.  This can have great societal benefit for Earthquake Early Warning on the west coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between the University of Memphis and UNAVCO will result in analytic methods for efficiently calibrating Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) Gladwin Tensor Strain Meters (GTSMs) using seismic data from earthquakes.  The investigators will extend methods previously developed by the University of Memphis that incorporate computation of reference, regional strain fields using seismic wave gradiometry for large earthquakes recorded by the ANZA southern California network. The present research will develop a method that incorporates a single three-component seismic sensor co-located with a GTSM to estimate strains from earthquake observations using wave gradiometry concepts rather than using a large array of seismic sensors.  UNAVCO has installed 3 broadband seismometers at PBO GTSMs in the ANZA network to augment existing broadband/GTSM installations and UCSD has installed a dense, broadband array of 13 sensors within the area of the Pinyon Flat facility.  Earthquake data from these new and existing co-located instruments will be used to estimate reference seismic strains that are then related to measured gauge strains by the GTSMs. An essential constraint in developing this method is that the ANZA GTSMs have been previously calibrated using the array method giving control on evaluating the success of the single station method. Data from the short-period seismometers installed with the GTSMs will also be incorporated in this work with the goal of using this existing data set to calibrate any other PBO strain meter without additional fieldwork.  The over arching scientific goal of this project is to use a well-calibrated GTSM and co-located seismic instrument as a partial ?gradient tensor? seismic instrument that can serve as a ?point? seismic array for analyzing the P-SV wave field.  Such an instrument can, in principle, find wave attributes such as propagation azimuth and slowness.  The ANZA PBO network is, therefore, an array of point arrays that can be used to study regional wave propagation, wave scattering, and source parameters from moderate events in southern California that should be useful in Earthquake Early Warning. This will be a new application of EarthScope facilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Part of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) constructed under NSF?s EarthScope initiative consists of 91 Borehole strain meters that were designed to detect and measure the time-dependent deformation of the crust in the coastal states of California, Oregon and Washington.  A borehole strain meter is an unusual scientific instrument in that the properties of the Earth immediately around the borehole defines the quality of signals that it measures. This project was concerned with developing data processing techniques and mathematical methods to calibrate borehole strain meters so their signals could be used in seismological studies of nearby earthquakes as well as studies involving long term crustal deformation.  The focus of this research was Southern California at the Pinyon Flat Observatory maintained by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) (Figure 1).  A dense array of 13 temporary broadband seismometers was deployed by personnel of UCSD independent of this research.  Pinyon Flat also contains a PBO borehole strain meter.  The objective was to first use the seismic array to estimate dynamic strains from relatively large nearby earthquakes and then mathematically compare the seismically-derived strains with strains measured by the borehole instrument.  Much of the research in this project involved developing new techniques to assess and then to correct the seismic array for measurement errors so that accurate seismic strains could be computed to compare with the borehole strains. A new way was developed to compute seismic strains at any position within the array which also improved implementation of a particular array analysis technique called wave gradiometry. Calibration of the Pinyon Flat borehole strain meter was accomplished using additional newly developed methods to implement the comparison of array-derived and borehole-measured seismic strains (Figure 2). Calibration demonstrated that the strain meter and a single, co-located seismic sensor could be used as a completely new kind of seismic instrument adding value to the original purpose of the EarthScope PBO strain meters.  The combination strain meter &ndash; seismic instrument can replace dense arrays of many seismic instruments in estimating the direction and speed of seismic signals.  Because of this capability, it can be considered to be an example of a "point" seismic array since observations at a single location on the Earth can accomplish what an array of many seismometers spread out over a large area can do.  A potential use for this new configuration of instruments is in Earthquake Early Warning since wave speeds and directions can be quickly found for initial seismic waves from nearby earthquakes, helping to locate the earthquake before damaging seismic waves arrive at population centers.
