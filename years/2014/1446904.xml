<AbstractNarration>The abundance of ozone in the stratosphere is the dominant control on surface ultra-violet radiation, which has important implications for life on Earth.  Stratospheric ozone also impacts the Earth's climate system by altering atmospheric circulation patterns, with implications for the ocean carbon cycle and sea ice extent.  It has been proposed that the end of the last glacial period, 18,000 years before present, was associated with a period of depleted stratospheric ozone that lasted over 200 years and was caused by a series of large eruptions from the Mt. Takahe volcano in West Antarctica.  This ozone depletion may have hastened the end of the last glacial maximum by changing atmospheric circulation patterns, reducing Antarctic sea ice extent and creating increased carbon emissions from the Southern Ocean.  This project will test a new method of determining past surface ultra-violet radiation levels by measuring the nitrogen isotopes of nitrate in shallow South Pole ice samples.  This research utilizes the modern-day ozone hole over Antarctica to test and calibrate this potential proxy, or substitute, for past Antarctic ozone holes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrate in snow is highly sensitive to the degree of ultraviolet-induced photo-dissociation of that nitrate.  This feature makes the measurement of nitrogen isotopes in ice cores a potential proxy (or substitute) for the ozone abundance in the stratosphere, which is the largest determinant of ultraviolet radiation levels at the Earth's surface.  A proxy for past surface ultraviolet radiation levels would provide a means to test the hypothesis that a 200-year ozone hole resulting from a series of stratospheric-scale volcanic eruptions in West Antarctica might have triggered rapid Antarctic de-glaciation 18 kyr ago.  We propose to test the use of nitrogen isotopes of nitrate as a proxy for past surface-ultraviolet radiation levels by measuring the nitrogen isotopes of nitrate at high resolution in the top 10 m of a previously drilled shallow ice core from the South Pole. The period contained in this ice is 1950-2004 Common Era (C.E.), which will allow researchers to examine and calibrate the nitrate isotope enrichment under the well-known modern-day ozone hole. This will inform the utility of similar measurements on samples from a period of volcanism 18 kyr before present from a new ice core being drilled at the South Pole ice core over the next two years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no field work in Antarctica as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT  The abundance of ozone in the stratosphere is the dominant control on surface ultra-violet radiation, which has important implications for life on Earth.  Stratospheric ozone also impacts the EarthÆs climate system by altering atmospheric circulation patterns, with implications for the ocean carbon cycle and sea ice extent.  It has been hypothesized that the end of the last glacial period was associated with a period of depleted stratospheric ozone that lasted over 200 years and may have hastened the end of the end of the last glacial period by changing atmospheric circulation patterns, reduced Antarctic sea ice extent, and contributed to increased carbon emissions from the Southern Ocean.  We tested a new method of determining past surface ultra-violet radiation levels by measuring the nitrogen isotopes of nitrate in shallow South Pole ice samples covering the period 1950-2005, making use of the fact that the nitrogen isotopes of snow nitrate are highly sensitive to surface ultraviolet radiation.  Ultraviolet radiation breaks apart the nitrate in the snow, emitting "light" nitrogen isotopes into the atmosphere, and leaving the "heavy" isotope of nitrate behind in the snow.  This research utilized the modern-day ozone hole over Antarctica to test and calibrate this potential proxy, or substitute, for past Antarctic ozone holes.      We expected to find an enrichment in the nitrogen isotopes of South Pole ice core nitrate beginning around the year 1980 when the Antarctic ozone hole became apparent.  We did not find such an enrichment.  We hypothesize that the lack of an enrichment in the nitrogen isotopes in South Pole ice after 1980, despite the increase in surface ultraviolet radiation, is due to the spatial redistribution of the "light" nitrogen emitted from the East Antarctic plateau snowpack, which is then transported to the South Pole.  The South Pole, which is downwind of the plateau, receives this "light" or depleted nitrogen from the plateau, which masks the enrichment of the nitrogen isotopes of nitrate in South Pole snow due to increased surface ultraviolet radiation since 1980.  We conclude that the South Pole is not the ideal place to measure because of its location downwind of the plateau, and that ice core samples from the East Antarctic plateau would be the best location to further examine this proxy.      BROADER IMPACTS  The intensity of ultraviolet radiation on the EarthÆs surface has critical implications for life on Earth, and may have significant impacts on global climate.  There has so far been no good geologic proxy to measure this critical parameter in the past.  By utilizing a previously drilled ice core from the South Pole, we were able to investigate the use of a novel proxy for past surface UV radiation at this location at minimal cost.  We have made use of the modern-day ozone hole, as the evolution of the magnitude, duration, and extent of the modern-day ozone hole is well-known. Due to the valuable nature of deep ice core samples, adequately testing this novel proxy for past surface-UV levels from a shallow South Pole ice core is prudent before sampling from the new deep SPICE core which is currently being collected at the South Pole.  This research has informed the utility of similar measurements from the new South Pole ice core in the past.
