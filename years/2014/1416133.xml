<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the field of advanced manufacturing. This project develops a low cost, high resolution nanomanufacturing technology platform for building optical fiber devices with approaches that are currently out of reach because of manufacturing cost. While both size and cost reductions are needed for this technology to address the optical component market, if successful, demand could reach 8 figures for a single customer. This technology could thus transform optics manufacturing across the entire spectrum of markets that use photonics: including biomedical, energy, military, and consumer markets. If it meets the needs of the photonics sector, this platform, which uses a template to assemble building blocks into composite materials, could penetrate a much broader commercial marketplace. One example includes extending additive manufacturing (3D printing) to nanoelectronics, information technology, and personalized low-cost manufacturing of consumer devices. The scientific and technological understanding created by developing this platform could enable businesses to leverage low-cost U.S.-based nanomanufacturing to address markets for advanced materials and components around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will miniaturize optical fiber components that are used in fiber optical line cards, by leveraging an advanced nanomanufacturing platform with potential to reduce component cost as well. These optical line cards contain many cylindrical components that are 5 mm in diameter, each of which performs different operations on the optical signals coming into the card, and then routes certain signals to output optical signals. Being able to reduce component size means optical fiber component manufacturers can pack more components into a given physical space, or reduce the overall footprint of a line card without negatively impacting performance or increasing cost. Phase I research activities will include assembling prototype components with diameters approaching 1 mm, verifying that component performance can approach that of current devices, and evaluating specific manufacturing and assembly strategies to assess size reduction and manufacturing cost. Expected results include performance data and an accurate forecast of the required technical innovations and trade-offs needed to reduce component size without increasing manufacturing cost.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I projectÆs task was to derisk a transformative nanomanufacturing technology. Known as Pattern Transfer Nanomanufacturing(PTNMTM), this technology produces commercially viable diffractive optical elements that are smaller and more cost effective than currently available alternatives.  The intellectual merit of this project involved optimizing the PTNMTM platform for assembling magnetic nanoparticles into user-designed patterns with an arbitrary width onto the surface of magnetic field templates.  A number of project outcomes resulted from this award:  -       The performance of the instrument used to record these field templates was improved to increase the manufacturing productivity.  -       Robotic systems were built to enhance the repeatability and quality of manufactured pattern assemblies.  These patterns were then transferred to transparent materials, creating commercial optical coatings.  -       New techniques were developed to further transfer these patterns on to the end surface of optical fibers, gradient-index (GRIN) lenses, and coverslips, creating miniature diffractive optics that canÆt be manufactured using conventional wafer-based or holographic lithography techniques in a cost-effective way.  -       Small form factor optical splitters were manufactured by transferring PTNMTM diffraction gratings to the surface of GRIN lenses that are coupled with optical fibers and their performance was analyzed.  -       New manufacturing processes were established to enhance the diffraction efficiency of PTNMTM gratings dramatically, to more than 80%. The diffraction efficiency can be precisely controlled by tuning manufacturing parameters, which allows for the customization of optical splitters with various splitting ratios.  -       The high-efficiency PTNMTM grating/GRIN assembly was employed to produce optical spectrographs in the spectrometer geometry with high-throughput.  The broader impacts of this award include successful R&amp;D activities to ready the PTNMTM technology for commercial scale-up, in order to manufacture high efficiency diffraction gratings that can be applied to any optical surface has great potential to provide fiber optics and spectrometers markets with low cost optical components that approach the fiber diameter in size, while meeting current performance specifications. In addition, more than 120 customers were contacted, 40 of them deemed high-value contacts, and this customer discovery process has identified a specific set of optical coating markets that could strongly benefit from coatings manufactured with PTNMTM technology.
