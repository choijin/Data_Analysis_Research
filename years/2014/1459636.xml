<AbstractNarration>Geologic archives of past climate variability enable scientists to put recent climate changes in broader temporal context and to investigate the mechanisms behind climate variability on longer timescales than is possible using instrumental climate data alone. Massive corals are one such geologic archive. Strontium-to-calcium elemental ratios (Sr/Ca) in coral skeletons are influenced by the temperature of the water in which the coral grew.  This relationship, combined with the relatively fast growth rates and long life-span of some corals, enables scientists to reconstruct centuries-long records of tropical ocean temperatures from coral geochemistry.  A major assumption underlying coral Sr/Ca-based temperature reconstructions is that the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater is the same everywhere in the ocean and is constant over at least the time period spanned by the coral record. However, there are processes that may cause variations in the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater, especially in shallow coastal areas where corals grow. This research investigates the magnitude of seawater Sr/Ca fluctuations over time and space in different coral reef settings using an analytical method that will be developed for rapid, inexpensive seawater Sr/Ca determinations.  The method is designed to enable seawater Sr/Ca measurements to be a routine part of coral paleoclimate sample collection.  The anticipated findings will enable valuable recommendations to the scientific community regarding site selection criteria and seawater sampling for future coral Sr/Ca-based paleoclimate research and should ultimately lead to greater accuracy and reliability of this important scientific tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include substantial efforts to communicate the research to lay audiences. With help from the University of Maryland's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) outreach coordinator, a secondary school teacher will be invited to participate in a field expedition. Both of these educational specialists will work with the project Principle Investigators to maintain a blog, create a video journal, and develop/disseminate a lesson plan compatible with new curriculum standards and used in the classroom as well as in educational activities of the CBL Visitor Center.  By sharing the science with teachers, their students, and Visitor Center volunteer staff and patrons, the project participants will engage citizens in the local community as well as the nearly 2700 tourists that enjoy the Visitor Center annually. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific approach will be to conduct a spatially and temporally intensive study of seawater Sr/Ca ratios and other associated variables on fringing reefs in three physiographic settings: a continental-scale carbonate platform (Florida Keys), a small siliciclastic island (St. John, US Virgin Islands) and a small carbonate island (Anegada, British Virgin Islands).  Analysis of Sr/Ca ratios in the seawater samples will be based on the existing ICP-AES method for aragonite analysis modified to consistently attain accuracy and precision of 0.1% or better in a complex seawater matrix. Other techniques, including ICP-MS or ion chromatography will be used to verify the accuracy of measured Sr/Ca ratios and to analyze complementary geochemical data. Seawater samples will be collected in the winter and summer from channel cuts, lagoon, patch reef, reef crest, fore reef, and open ocean sites in the Florida Keys. Continuous records will be collected with osmosampler pumps in these locations during the intervening periods.  Concurrent measurements of temperature with thermistors, and subsequent Sr/Ca analysis of coral nubbins placed near the equipment will enable verification and quantification of the impact of both water chemistry and temperature on coral aragonite Sr/Ca ratios. This sampling scheme will allow assessment of the influences of salinity, upwelling, river and groundwater inputs, and variations in productivity.  The impacts of different physiographic environments on coastal seawater Sr/Ca will be assessed by comparisons between similar data collected in the FL Keys and British Virgin Islands. Differential effect of various parameters on the entire dataset in space and time will be determined by a combination of time series and principal components analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>If we wish to learn how human activities are affecting Earth's climate, we need to first understand the situation before society had any influence on it. Of particular importance is the temperature of the upper ocean, which is the main carrier of heat from the tropical to the polar latitudes and thus a major driver of the global climate system. Unfortunately, sea surface temperature (SST) has only been routinely and accurately measured since the late 1800s, which is too short to distinguish natural cycles on time scales of tens to hundreds of years. Climate scientists can use the chemistry of tropical corals to create detailed histories of SST that go back well before the instrumental record. While a single coral polyp does not live long, a colony can persist for hundreds of years, slowly building a reef out of a limestone mineral called aragonite and growing in annual bands, like tree rings. The polyps extract the ingredients to make aragonite, calcium (Ca) and carbonate, out of the surrounding seawater. They also include tiny amounts of a Ca-like element called strontium (Sr). When SST increases, a little less Sr is included, and <em>vice versa</em>, in a predictable way. By drilling a solid core from a coral boulder and measuring the Sr/Ca ratio along its length, SST at the time when the aragonite was formed can be calculated. By counting down from the top of a live coral, or from an accurately dated point in a fossil coral, the year of each annual band can be exactly determined and tied to a specific SST value. That way, SST can be reconstructed far into the past, often with nearly monthly resolution. This is referred to as paleothermometry.</p> <p>What is actually of interest is not the absolute Sr/Ca ratio of the coral aragonite, but its changes relative to the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater. Because Sr and Ca are fairly unreactive and the oceans are very well mixed, the seawater Sr/Ca ratio is generally assumed to be constant across large regions and over very long periods of time. Small differences are commonly dealt with by measuring coral Sr/Ca within a time span overlapping the instrumental temperature record, in order to create calibration lines that can be applied to times when SST is unknown. It appears that these calibrations are broadly valid for individual coral species inside a certain area and, with this restriction, paleothermometry has been used successfully by numerous climate scientists throughout the world. However, significant problems may arise if the seawater Sr/Ca ratio would change on much smaller scales of space and time. The resulting errors could moreover be hard to detect if seawater Sr/Ca varies seasonally, matching the growth cycle of the coral itself. Such variations might result from mixing with river water or groundwater, local tides, severe weather events, differences in coastal geology, upwelling of deep water, and many other influences. Anomalous coral calibrations, reported for example in the Florida Keys and US Virgin Islands, have been tentatively attributed to this effect, but their explanations remain speculative.</p> <p>In our project, we addressed this issue by very carefully measuring the seawater Sr/Ca ratio at these two locations and on Anegada (British Virgin Islands), which is somewhat like Florida but far out in the ocean where Sr/Ca variations are less likely. Since seawater is much more difficult to analyze than coral, one student first had to devise a new method with the required precision. He then measured seawater Sr/Ca at more than 50 sites along the Florida Keys reef in winter and summer, for several years. A second student used automatic pumps on the seafloor to collect seawater continuously and measure Sr/Ca at 4 sites about once a week, for several years. Similar but more limited measurements were done in the USVI and BVI. At 3 of the Florida underwater sites we also grew multiple species of coral and recorded seawater temperature. We found that seawater Sr/Ca does indeed vary in space and time at all three locations, but in different ways and apparently for different reasons. In Florida, seasonal variations seem to originate in the shallow Florida Bay, just north of the reef, and may be caused by strong evaporation during summer. In the USVI, the variations are larger but irregular and may be caused by runoff from extreme rainstorms. We hope that our planned analyses of the Florida coral samples and comparisons with the known seawater temperature will shed additional light on the underlying processes. We will also measure other parameters in the seawater samples, such as oxygen isotope ratios and barium concentrations, to help us support or reject alternative explanations. We have submitted a description of our new method for publication and we will provide full details of all our findings in 3 or 4 future papers.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Johan&nbsp;Schijf</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1459636/1459636_10391157_1607626000949_Picture4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1459636/1459636_10391157_1607626000949_Picture4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Semi-annual maintenance"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1459636/1459636_10391157_1607626000949_Picture4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Semi-annual maintenance"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">PI Kilbourne (right) and graduate student Hunter Hughes service the underwater instrument package at the Tennessee Reef site in the Florida Keys.
