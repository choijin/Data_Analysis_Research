<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the creation of tools that democratize a new interactive medium called projection mapping. Projection mapping uses video projectors to overlay digital content (images, animations or video) onto 3D physical objects, allowing viewers to experience and interact with digital experiences in an entirely new way. These interactive displays will add value to a wide range of industries where dynamic, 3D presentations are needed to inform, educate, advertise or entertain. Applications include educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, new training and simulation displays, as well as broad uses in advertising and entertainment. For example, a retail end aisle display could more easily attract customers by demonstrating product features with projected light directly on or around the physical product. Alternatively, an interactive diorama in a museum could allow visitors to learn history through an immersive visual experience. This project will bring projection mapping from high budget, niche markets into low budget, mainstream markets. Cost reductions will be realized through technological advances that decrease design, setup and calibration requirements, which in turn will advance technological capabilities and content authoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel software and hardware system for authoring projection mapping content. The proposed system will greatly simplify a currently complex content authoring process, and will enable entirely new passive and interactive experiences which fuse digital content with the physical environment. The system is comprised of a content authoring software suite and a projector-depth camera hardware unit capable of high-resolution 3D scanning. Research objectives entail novel software algorithms in the areas of 1) automatic calibration of projector-camera systems, 2) optimized structured light scanning of 3D objects, 3) automatic, precise re-alignment and registration of the system in response to movement of the physical model, 4) intuitive authoring tools for creating passive and interactive projection mapping experiences.</AbstractNarration>

Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences.  In the Phase I project, Lumenous proposed and completed the following technical objectives towards addressing these needs:  - Calibration: state-of-the-art techniques to automatically calibrate single projector-camera systems  - Registration: interactive and non-interactive methods for aligning projection mapping content when the projector or display surface has been moved  - Segmentation and Intuitive Selection: segmentation techniques for easily identifying 3D objects in projection mapping scenes  - Improved Authoring Tools: software features incorporating to simplify projection mapping content creation  - Product Design and Fabrication: hardware designs for the LytBox, tested in a variety of scenarios (structural, mobility, cost, practicality)  - Projector Stacking: techniques for automatically aligning and controlling content in multiple projectors simultaneously   - Interactive Interfaces: interactive features for the LytBox  These proposed objectives were completed successfully, resulting in a minimum viable product. The LytBox led to LumenousÆ first customers as well as private, third-party investment to further commercialize this product. One of these customers, a large national retailer, has used LytBoxes for several months (including demonstrations at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show) and is evaluating a nation-wide deployment.
