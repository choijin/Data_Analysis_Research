<AbstractNarration>This project creates an international science research exchange between the Inupiaq students of the North Slope of Alaska and Zapotec and Purehepecha student of Oaxaca and Michoacan, Mexico to research, observe, and experience the science of biodiversity and climate change both in Mexico and Alaska.  Inupiaq students will travel to Mexico and Zapotec and Purehepecha students will travel to Alaska to immerse themselves in the local environment, language, and culture of each others regions. This exchange project will provide a global context within which local students can understand their environmental and social cultural experiences.  In addition, the anthropological investigators will be observing the cultural construction of science and education among the participants, including scientists, teachers, and students.</AbstractNarration>
