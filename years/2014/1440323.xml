<AbstractNarration>Geosciences software embodies crucial scientific knowledge, and as such it should be explicitly captured, curated, managed, and disseminated. The goal of this project is to create a system for software stewardship in geosciences that will empower scientists to manage their software as valuable scientific assets. Scientific software stewardship requires a combination of cyberinfrastructure, social infrastructure, and professional development infrastructure. The  framework will result in an open transparent and broader access to scientific software to other scientists, software professionals, students, and decision makers. It will significantly improve the adoption of open data and open software initiatives, improve reproducibility, and advance scientific scholarship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance knowledge and understanding of scientific software as a valuable community asset that is worth sharing, curating, cataloging, validating, reusing, and maintaining.&lt;br/&gt; 1) Facilitating software publication through TurboSoft, a personal assistant (analogous to TurboTax) that guides a user through best practices. Users will choose the degree of investment they are willing to make in componentizing, describing, licensing, and maintaining their software. The system will encourage open source publication, the formation of communities around the software, and set up mechanisms for software citation and credit. &lt;br/&gt;2) Enabling broad software dissemination through GeoSoft, a "software commons" for geosciences that will support software contributions (prepared through TurboSoft or otherwise), software discovery through multi-faceted search, and foster social interactions through dynamic formation of communities of interest. GeoSoft will interoperate with existing software repositories and modeling frameworks in geosciences. &lt;br/&gt;3) Providing just-in-time training materials through GeoCamp, an annotated collection of educational units ranging from basic education to professional training on all aspects of software stewardship. GeoCamp will be seamlessly integrated with TurboSoft and GeoSoft, and present a wide range of options for learning in the context of a user?s context of interaction with the framework or independently.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geosciences software embodies crucial scientific knowledge, and as such it should be explicitly captured, managed, and disseminated. The goal of this project was to improve software stewardship in geosciences by empowering scientists to manage their software as valuable scientific assets. Scientific software stewardship requires a combination of cyberinfrastructure, social infrastructure, and professional development infrastructure. Software stewardship practices give open transparent and broader access to scientific software to other scientists, software professionals, students, and decision makers.   In this project we developed OntoSoft, a framework for cataloguing of scientific software that follows best practices for open software sharing and reuse.  OntoSoft is a federated catalog, so each scientific community can maintain its own repository but all repositories are interconnected.  OntoSoft includes a distributed query system to enable users to find software across different OntoSoft repositories.  OntoSoft allows crowdsourcing of software metadata by incorporating an access control system in OntoSoft so users can control who can edit the metadata about their software.  To improve awareness and train scientists to improve software dissemination, this project also resulted in the Geoscience Papers of the Future (GPF) Initiative.  This initiative, initially developed by the 30+ members of OntoSoft’s Early Career Advisory Committee, produced training materials that were used in dozens of training sessions that involved hundreds of geoscientists.  These sessions were held at conferences, universities, and government laboratories.  The sessions teach scientists to write papers that incorporate best practices of open source data and software sharing, reproducible publications, and digital scholarship. We refer to these papers as Geoscience Papers of the Future. A Special Issue of the American Geophysical Union’s Earth and Space Science journal included a collection of such papers.  The initiative had particularly strong uptake in the geospace sciences community, which studies the interactions between the Earth’s upper atmosphere with interplanetary space.  A broader follow up of this initiative was the Scientific Paper of the Future initiative, with participation from neuroscience and more recently the artificial intelligence communities.
