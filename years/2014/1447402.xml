<AbstractNarration>The  broader  impact/commercial  potential  of   this Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR)  Phase  I  project include  saving  energy,  lowering  industrial  and power  generation-caused  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  improving  the  competitiveness  of  U.S. industry, and reducing the quantity of chemicals introduced into the nation?s water supplies. More than 1% of U.S. energy  consumption  is  expended  overcoming  the  insulating  effects  of  naturally occurring mineral  fouling.   This technology has the potential to reduce U.S. energy consumption by 0.7 to 1.9% of annual US carbon-based energy representing from .55 to 1.5 quads. The reductions in energy consumption will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) on the order of 54.1 to 125.8 million metric tons of GHGs.   Recognizing climate change is a worldwide problem, if fully deployed to other industrialized nations, this technology has the potential to eliminate 0.7% to 1.7% of the world's GHGs which equal 252.6 to 571.3 million metric tons of GHGs. The competitiveness of US products will be improved by large reductions of energy-related manufacturing costs without need of capital investment, and it will reduce chemical additives to cooling tower water. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks a solution to "the major unresolved problem of heat transfer" which is naturally occurring mineral fouling on heat transfer surfaces (HTS).  This often overlooked problem consumes 1% of the total energy consumed by the U.S. and other industrialized nations, and represents 1% of our planet's greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of the research is to develop long-lasting thin film coatings, which can protect HTS from fouling, while not impeding thermal efficiency.    Using recently discovered nanomaterials, solution is applied as a coating to transform the surface properties of HTS to ones having the lowest surface energy values that have ever been created.  With a low surface energy, the coatings reduce fouling nucleation as well as reducing fouling adherence to the HTS.  The low adhesion of any fouling which nucleates, combined with  the  action  of  water  flowing  over  the  HTS  should  cause  the  release  of  any  remaining  fouling, effectively   making   the  surfaces   "self-cleaning."   This self-cleaning mechanism has been successfully demonstrated in laboratory experiments. This  research  examines  the  fundamental  chemistry  and  materials  science  of  a  new  class  of  low  surface energy  self-assembling  ultra hydrophobic  nanocoatings  that  could  spawn  innovation  across  a  range  of disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nano Hydrophobics Inc., (Nano), has developed a breakthrough, low surface energy, nano-composite polymer coating, which for the first time, can prevent or retard mineral fouling from forming on heat exchanger surfaces to improve their thermal efficiency.  The challenge of improving HX efficiency is considered important because fouling is viewed as "the major unresolved problem of heat transfer."  It costs the U.S. economy approximately $40 billion per year, wastes about $3 Billion of energy, and generates about 1% of the U.S.Æs greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Fouling is a worldwide manufacturing problem, a contributor to our planetÆs GHGs, and a problem that will never cease.  Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in most industrial manufacturing processes, such as chemical processing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing and many more.  Air conditioning for large office and residential structures also represents a significant use of heat exchangers.  In a heat exchanger, hot and cold fluids are separated by a metal sheet or tube, which transfers the heat from the hot side to the cold side.   In most cases, the cold fluid is water, which typically contains some amount of naturally dissolved minerals.  As cooling water comes into contact with hot surfaces, the dissolved minerals in the cooling water, such as calcium carbonate, become small crystals and strongly attach to the hot heat transfer surface.  As the crystals form a mineral layer on the heat transfer surface, the rate of heat transfer declines &ndash; often dramatically.  The fouling reduces heat transfer efficiency because most minerals are poor conductors of heat and function as an insulator.    NanoÆs coating creates a æno stickÆ surface that makes it difficult for minerals to attach to the heat transfer surface.  So by keeping the surface of the heat exchanger clean, the coating improves manufacturersÆ production efficiency, reduces costs &ndash; especially energy costs, and shrinks their carbon footprints. Widespread usage of NanoÆs coating in heat exchangers will deliver significant benefits including:  1) Economic  Reduction of the estimated annual $40 billion cost of fouling, and reduction in the amount of energy wasted to overcome fouling.  It will also enable manufacturing processes to be run faster and at higher temperatures, and increase the meantime between maintenance-required plant shutdowns.   2) Environmental  Reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the excess energy usage Reduce the usage of chemicals currently used in water treatment to combat fouling           Last Modified: 02/23/2016       Submitted by: Sebnem Inceoglu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
