<AbstractNarration>The predicted 2014-2015 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event may develop into one of the strongest in recent history, presenting a unique and urgent opportunity to investigate the impact of this extreme thermal anomaly on the resilience of coral reef ecosystems. Building on baseline data from &gt;40 years of research in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), this team of researchers is uniquely poised to test hypotheses about coral reef resilience to the third strong event to hit this region. Ecological resilience is defined as both the ability of an ecosystem to continue functioning while under stress as well as the ability of a system to "bounce back" or restore structure and function following a disturbance. This project is guided by the overarching hypothesis that many ETP coral reefs are becoming more resilient in the face of multiple major ENSO disturbances as a result of adaptive processes. If the investigators are correct that reef systems can develop more tolerance and recover more rapidly when subjected to sequential thermal disturbances, this will drastically change predictions of the fate of global coral reef ecosystems over the next 100 years of climate change. The Broader Impacts of this proposal include mentoring, outreach, and education. To engage a broad audience, all participants will contribute to a project Facebook page, which will be linked to a blogging website where the public can interact with the scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID funding will provide an unprecedented opportunity to further our understanding of the potential for increased resistance to, and accelerated early recovery from, the third major ENSO to hit the ETP. The investigators have developed hypotheses that can be tested by targeted sampling and experiments in the critical stages before, during and after this ENSO on reefs in Panamá (Uva, Saboga) and Galápagos (Darwin Floreana). These reefs span a gradient in aragonite saturation that provides a real-world model system for conditions expected throughout the tropics in a high-CO2 world. Key mechanisms/hypotheses that the investigators will evaluate that may increase resilience, and therefore reduce mortality and limit the loss of ecosystem functioning following this ENSO, include: (1) increases in the relative abundance of thermotolerant symbionts will result in higher survival and faster recovery of multiple coral species across all depths; (2) recovery will be inversely rated to pCO2 with a threshold level beyond which recovery does not occur; (3) the maintenance of strong top-down control by intact herbivore communities will limit algal proliferation, and (4) the strengthening of nutrient-limitation in shallow regions will limit algal competitive abilities and aid coral recovery. At each site where there is a record of recovery the research team will make the following ovservations:  (1) in situ measurement of physical parameters (temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, photosynthetically active radiation, chlorophyll, turbidity, inorganic nutrients); (2) in situ measurement of carbonate chemistry and net ecosystem metabolism (calcification, production); (3) In situ measurements of coral and reef community responses including coral bleaching and mortality and the population responses of corallivores, bioeroders, herbivores, and benthic algal cover; (4) quantification of symbiont communities in major coral species before, during and after the bleaching event to compare with archived samples from the 1997-98 event; (5) bioassays of the strength of top-down (herbivory) and bottom-up (nutrient limitation) effects that may promote ecosystem resilience with critical limits. To further explore these limits, in the southern Galápagos, where there is a lack of resilience, the investigative team will deploy temperature loggers, conduct surveys of bleaching and mortality of remnant coral communities, and conduct bioassays of the strength of herbivory and nutrient limitation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For our RAPID project, <strong>our overarching hypothesis was that many coral reefs in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) are becoming more resilient</strong> in the face of multiple major ENSO disturbances as a result of adaptive processes.&nbsp; If we are correct that reef systems can develop more tolerance and recover faster when subjected to sequential thermal disturbances, this will drastically change predictions of the fate of global coral reef ecosystems over the next 100 years of climate change. However, <strong>we also predicted there will be a limit to resilience</strong> beyond which reefs can no longer adapt and ecosystem functions break down. While many reefs of the ETP appear to be recovering rapidly, there has been no recovery at sites chronically exposed to high-CO<sub>2</sub>/low pH conditions (e.g., the southern Gal&aacute;pagos), suggesting a possible acidification threshold or tipping point for reef resilience to repeated thermal stress. Thus, this ENSO provides a unique opportunity to transform our understanding of coral reef resilience, and especially its limits, in the face of climate-related disturbance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We developed hypotheses that we tested by targeted sampling and experiments in the critical stages before and during the ENSO on reefs in Panam&aacute; (Uva and Saboga) and Gal&aacute;pagos (Darwin and Floreana). We will continue these efforts after this ENSO with funds from National Geographic and NOAA. Our study reefs span a documented gradient in acidification that provides a real-world model system for conditions expected throughout the tropics in a high-CO<sub>2 </sub>world. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In each site with a track record of recovery, methods included: (1) in situ measurement of physical parameters (temperature, conductivity, pH, DO, PAR, chlorophyll, turbidity, inorganic nutrients); (2) in situ measurement of carbonate chemistry and net ecosystem metabolism (calcification, production); (3) In situ measurements of coral and reef community responses including coral bleaching and mortality and the population responses of corallivores, bioeroders, herbivores, and benthic algal cover; (4) quantification of symbiont communities in major coral species before, during and after the bleaching event to compare with archived samples from the 1997-98 event; &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key Outcomes</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1) Bleaching was overall greatest on Uva Island reef than in the Gulf of Panama or the Galapagos, especially the shallow zones.&nbsp; Deeper reef zones bleached significantly less, providing a refuge from stress during this time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2) Temperature data from Uva Is. indicates that, for near surface corals, temperature conditions and stress accumulation were lower in the second year (2015-16) than in the first year of the event (2014-15).&nbsp; These data are critical to help us understand the 2015-16 event in the context of past episodes and the potential adaptation of reefs to repeated warming.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3) At each site, we&rsquo;ve deployed paired SeaFET pH and SAMI- or Pro-Oceanus CO<sub>2</sub> sensors, providing a long time-series of &Omega;<sub>arag </sub>before, during, and after bleaching. Quality data were obtained for &gt; 6 months, showing that reefs in Panama had a higher diurnal pH range than that from 68 different reefs across 10 regions spanning the Pacific and Indian Oceans (Manzello, unpub. data). In 2014 and 2015, the carbon metabolism of bleached reefs was investigated using the Benthic Ecosystem and Acidification Measurement System (BEAMS), which uses boundary layer flux methods.&nbsp;During bleaching, there was a decline in calcification and productivity, an increase in [H<sup>+</sup>] flux from the reef (i.e., localized acidification), and increased nighttime dissolution. To our knowledge this was the first time carbonate chemistry and reef metabolism were<sub> </sub>measured during a coral bleaching event. The documented localized acidification and increased dissolution during bleaching has serious implications for reef structural persistence with warming and acidification.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;4) Top-down control by relatively intact herbivore communities strengthened significantly during ENSO in Panama, limiting algal proliferation during the time when coral was most vulnerable to competition. In contrast, the extremely strong baseline force of herbivory (pre-ENSO) in the Galapagos and did not change during ENSO.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>5) Bottom up control of algae via nutrient-limitation also intensified during ENSO in Panama, limiting algal competitive abilities. However, while algae suffered widespread mortality during ENSO in the Galapagos, this was not related to nutrient limitation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/28/2017<br>      Modified by: Tyler&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1447300/1447300_10312204_1493401585127_IMG_0880--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1447300/1447300_10312204_1493401585127_IMG_0880--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The Uva 4x5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1447300/1447300_10312204_1493401585127_IMG_0880--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The Uva 4x5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The living coral framework of the long-term Uva Island study site within a plot established in 1984.

Deeper reef zones bleached significantly less, providing a refuge from stress during this time.     2) Temperature data from Uva Is. indicates that, for near surface corals, temperature conditions and stress accumulation were lower in the second year (2015-16) than in the first year of the event (2014-15).  These data are critical to help us understand the 2015-16 event in the context of past episodes and the potential adaptation of reefs to repeated warming.     3) At each site, we?ve deployed paired SeaFET pH and SAMI- or Pro-Oceanus CO2 sensors, providing a long time-series of &Omega;arag before, during, and after bleaching.
