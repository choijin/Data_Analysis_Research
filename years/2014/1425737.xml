<AbstractNarration>In the United States, 6 million bone fractures occur annually, and 5-10% of these fractures fail to heal adequately due to bone loss, failed fixation, infection, and inadequate vascularization. The use of biomaterials that can promote bone regeneration by taking advantage of the body?s own natural healing ability would bypass all of the problems associated with autografts and allografts. The key challenge in developing orthopedic implants for the repair and regeneration of large bone defects in load-bearing applications is to strike the right balance between material properties, implant architecture and bioactivity to satisfy the functional and regenerative requirements of bone tissue. Dr. Hala Zreiqat and Dr. Roohani-Esfahani at the University of Sydney in Australia have made major advances towards achieving this goal through the development of a new multi-component ceramic that can mimic bone in porosity (80-95%), pore diameter (300-500um) and, uniquely, mechanical strength. These scaffolds caused extensive new bone formation with complete bridging of critically sized radial defects in rabbits. However, implantation of biomaterials into injured bone affects the behavior of the cells of the inflammatory response, especially macrophages, with resulting effects on new bone regeneration. The main research focus of this proposal is how the behavior of macrophages dictates tissue regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the importance of macrophages and the inflammatory response for the repair of all tissues, the results of this work are broadly applicable for engineering of any tissue. In addition, this project will promote cross-cultural exchange between American and Australian engineering students and faculty. Three of the five participants in this project are women engineers.</AbstractNarration>

Bone repair is a complex process with the cells of the inflammatory response, especially macrophages, playing a major role. The implantation of biomaterials into injured bone affects the behavior of these cells and their interactions, with resulting effects on new bone regeneration. We have previously shown that pro-inflammatory ("M1") macrophages are useful at early stages of wound healing because they initiate angiogenesis, and then anti-inflammatory ("M2") macrophages must take over in order to promote stabilization of growing blood vessels and tissue maturation. Thus, we hypothesized that part of the success of the Sr-HT-Gh scaffolds is a result of positive interactions with macrophages.  In this work, we aimed to elucidate the role of M1 and M2 macrophages with respect to biomaterial-mediated bone repair.

Ultimately, understanding the interactions between biomaterials and cells of the inflammatory response will enable us to better design biomaterials that harness the bodyÆs natural ability to repair and regenerate tissue.
