<AbstractNarration>The Consortia for Improving Medicine with Innovation &amp; Technology (CIMIT) is a consortium of greater Boston's premier clinical, research and academic institutions. It is headquartered administratively at Massachusetts General Hospital and involves an ever-growing network of collaborators and affiliates. It is also a core member of the Boston BioMedical Innovation Center (B-BIC). The CIMIT/B-BIC Regional Healthcare I-Corps Hub (the "Hub") is a unique resource for the perennial community of healthcare innovators and innovations emerging from across New England's many world-class academic medical centers and institutions. The Hub will provide critical innovation-related skills development for teams of healthcare innovators through the facilitated experiential learning "Customer Development" curriculum that is used to support NSF I-Corps teams. The Hub will take advantage of the B-BIC program and effectively leverage the area's resources, since it will be based at the Consortia for Improving Medicine with Innovation and Technology (CIMIT). CIMIT is a consortium of greater Boston's premier clinical, research and academic institutions with a growing network of collaborators and affiliates, housed administratively at Massachusetts General Hospital and is a core member of B-BIC. It is a "living lab" of healthcare innovation with the mission to improve patient care by facilitating collaboration among clinicians, scientists, and engineers along with entrepreneurs and companies. The goal of the Hub is to address important unmet clinical needs and focus on building innovation capacity at its member institutions; while rapidly developing and implementing innovative products, services, procedures and workflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Hub will make important contributions to the area's healthcare and biomedical ecosystem, while also greatly benefiting from it. The Hub will amplify CIMIT and B-BIC's resources and help fill the gaps between the area's existing healthcare innovation resources; stemming from the teams working on basic science to the area's strong collection of small and medium enterprises, as well as multi-nationals. It will draw teams of innovators from the ecosystem and, in return, provide a source of innovative teams with higher chances of commercial success for funding and support. It is expected that the Hub will make many contributions to NSF's network of Regional I-Corps Hubs, while also learning from the other industries and NIN experiences in different regions of the nation.</AbstractNarration>

CIMIT started with and built on the NSF I-Corps program and blended its healthcare specific commercialization experience and expertise to develop and deliver a prototype program that addressed the unique challenges experienced in commercializing healthcare related science and technologies: The CIMIT Healthcare Commercialization Boot Camp.  A cohort of nine teams with "HealthTech" innovations from across CIMITÆs network of institutions participated in the 7-week Boot Camp pilot run over the summer of 2015, with very positive feedback along with near immediate tangible results. The program combined experiential learning with interactive lectures and exercises to help teams build a sustainable business by addressing and balancing the needs of the multiple stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem: patients, clinicians, regulators, buyers, insurers, etc. A full-day, in-person kick-off meeting and a half-day finale meeting bracketed six, 2.5 hour long webinars. Every session included team presentations, interactive didactic lectures on specific topics, including market needs assessment, defining target customers and value propositions, competitive analysis, intellectual property strategy, and regulatory and reimbursement pathways.  Teams were supported with one-on-one mentoring by an experienced healthcare entrepreneur from CIMTÆs Accelerator team. They worked to develop and validate a viable business model, commercialization roadmap and "pitch" by speaking with potential customers and influencers to validate key commercialization assumptions regarding target customers, clinical needs, value propositions, and IP, regulatory and reimbursement pathways.

CIMIT solicited feedback and experiences from the two other NIH Centers for Accelerated Innovation (NCAIs) at the National Heart, Lung, Blood and Sleep Institute (NHLBI), one based at the Cleveland Clinic and the other at the University of California system, that the NSF supported in parallel, to develop a refined program for healthcare innovators.  CIMIT is now in a position to offer teams from across the country the opportunity to participate in a program that helps advance healthcare innovations into practice while learning commercialization skills that they can apply to future innovations.   The Lessons Learned from all three programs was recently presented to a joint meeting of the NCAIs and recently awarded NIH Research ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
