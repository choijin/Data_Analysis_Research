<AbstractNarration>A large body of evidence supports the value of traditional research apprenticeships in the academic, personal, and career development of undergraduates. The College of Biological Sciences at the University of Minnesota has embedded authentic research experiences in all of their introductory biology courses. As a result, more than 4,000 students currently engage in classroom-based authentic research experiences each year. This project will expand that effort so that students can advance from their initial classroom designed research experiences to the full range of scientific inquiry, from asking a question to producing new knowledge. This proposal is inspired by the Integrated Science Education Outreach (InSciEd Out) Program (http://insciedout.org/), which involves middle school children in research projects that produce publishable results.  The project (dubbed InSciED-In) is designed to provide undergraduate students, including both biology majors and non-majors, with a rigorous, comprehensive research experience that includes observation, questioning, hypothesis building, experimental design, data collection/analysis/presentation, and the expectation that, through this work, they will discover new knowledge.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Based on evidence from pilot studies some student projects will result in publishable research, enhancing understanding of basic processes of life, including the genetics of complex traits, developmental biology, behavior, and ecosystems. Implementing the InSciED-In approach on this large scale creates an opportunity to examine differences in student outcomes between inquiry-based labs, classroom-based research apprenticeships, faculty-led research apprenticeships, and complete (InSciED-In) research experiences. A further educational research topic scheduled to be examined is whether discovery-based research that uses computational approaches to probe databases provides learning outcomes equivalent to those achieved through bench-based research experiences. These analyses promise to produce better understanding of which types of research experiences have the greatest positive impact on students, and which students are most affected.  Over the five years of this grant, more than 11,000 non-majors and 2,000 majors will participate in an InSciED-In research experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Our overarching goal was to help students develop skills and habits of mind that will enable them to apply scientific processes appropriately in their daily lives. To that end, we engaged thousands of students each year in classroom-based authentic research experiences and identified experiences that are most likely to achieve the transformative outcomes that we seek.      We had two specific aims:   1. To provide undergraduate students, including biology majors and non-majors, with a rigorous, comprehensive research experience that includes observation, hypothesis building, experimental design, data collection/analysis/presentation, and the expectation of discovery of new knowledge.           2. To compare the outcomes of traditional research apprenticeships, inquiry-based classroom labs, classroom-based authentic research experiences that involve "wet-lab" methodologies, and that involve data analysis methodologies, so that we can identify the types of research experiences that are most effective for learning scientific process skills and improving attitudes and confidence toward science.           As we conclude the grant period, we have successfully implemented course-based research experiences into all of our introductory biology courses--majors and non-majors, which collectively serve over 6000 students per year. As we have developed and implemented these experiences, we have thoroughly assessed them and shared our findings via several presentations and peer-reviewed publications.   Moving forward, we plan to continue reviewing our inquiry-based curricula, modifying research projects as our needs change, and assessing which experiences best serve our diverse student needs. Follow-up projects include training our laboratory teaching assistants to facilitate inquiry and implementing authentic curricular research experiences that can be explored in an online environment (not only during COVID, but also beyond).
