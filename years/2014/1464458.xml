<AbstractNarration>The project will examine the seasonal composition of ambient aerosols at an urban site in Maryland to better understand the contribution of aqueous-phase reactions occurring in aerosols as a source secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  SOA, in contrast to gas-to-particle conversion, constitutes a major fraction of fine (PM2.5um) particle mass in the atmosphere. However, an under-prediction of SOA concentrations by state-of-the-art models indicates that a mechanistic understanding of SOA formation pathways is lacking. The uptake and reaction of soluble organic gases in aqueous aerosols is argued to be an important source of SOA formation that traditional models have neglected. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;SOA constitutes a major fraction of fine (PM2.5um) particle mass in the atmosphere, and impacts atmospheric visibility, radiation balance, and also human health. This investigation meets the EAGER criteria because a key part of the analytical work (i.e. fast switching of a tandem PILS ? particle into liquid sampler) the proposal depends upon is exploratory in nature, and the approach largely untested. If successful, this would also provide the foundation for a broader, more comprehensive definition of the composition and the reactivity of water soluble SOA transformation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) imparts harmful effects on human health and is an important component of EarthÆs climate system.  This was a one-year award, with the overarching goal of developing a new method to measure different fractions of organic compounds in atmospheric PM.  The fractions of interest are water-soluble organic compounds formed through the reversible and irreversible uptake of organic gases to the water contained in PM.  Laboratory studies have shown that both processes can be important, and models indicate that the pathway &ndash; reversible or irreversible &ndash; can have dramatically different impacts on the amount of PM in the atmosphere.  Prior to this study, there had not been an analytical technique capable of quantifying and differentiating these PM fractions (called reversible and irreversible aqSOA).  The major components of the system are: a Particle-into-Liquid Sampler for the collection of water-soluble PM, a mist chamber for the collection of soluble gases, and a Total Organic Carbon Analyzer for the analysis of the collected samples.  The PM sample is alternated through a dry channel and through a channel that maintains the ambient conditions.  This allows for the determination of any differences in the organic PM concentration due to particle water evaporation.  After the system was developed and evaluated through rigorous laboratory testing, it was deployed to make ambient measurements in Baltimore, MD (see attached figure).  The measurements were carried out for ~3 weeks in each season.  We anticipate that this newly developed method will be used to study atmospheric processes, including PM formation, extensively in the future.  Analysis of the complete dataset from all four seasons is ongoing.  To date, we have completed analysis of the fall dataset, which yielded several important findings.  We observed the uptake of water-soluble organic gases into particle water as an important source of PM in Baltimore during this time.  Because particle water modulates up and down throughout the day as a result of changing relative humidity, it was important to characterize the fate of these organic compounds (which had transitioned from the gas phase to particle water) when the particles were dried.  This would provide direct insight into the reversible or irreversible nature of the uptake process.  During the fall, there was no difference in the concentration of the water-soluble organic PM measured through the two channels (ædriedÆ channel and the æambientÆ channel).  This indicates that the soluble organic gases that were taken up into the particle water remained in the particle phase even when the water evaporated: i.e., the uptake was irreversible.  This was the first study to directly measure irreversible PM formation in particle water in the atmosphere.  Although analysis of the measurements during the other seasons is ongoing, our preliminary results show different behavior in the spring and summer seasons.  This is potentially very exciting, as it would offer additional insight into important PM formation processes.  We anticipate that the work will have another impact on our understanding of PM through its use for model evaluation and improvement.  Atmospheric models are critical tools used to test our understanding of many processes (for example, emissions and transport of pollutants) and to assess their impacts.  A key element of any modeling exercise is the evaluation of model performance through comparisons to experimental or ambient data.  In this case, the dataset collected through this project will serve as an ideal comparison for models to characterize &ndash; and ultimately improve upon &ndash; our current understanding of PM formation.  Finally, activities associated with this work directly contributed to broader impacts in education and training.  One graduate student pursuing a PhD was supported full time on the award.
