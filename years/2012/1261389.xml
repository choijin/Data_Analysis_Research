<AbstractNarration>This project, Diverse People for a Diverse Science, takes the Ecological Society of America's Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability (SEEDS) program into Phase IV of its mission. It integrates a set of existing and new programs into a sequence of activities that build upon previous experiences and an infrastructure of support designed to retain minorities in ecology.   Specifically, students from groups underrepresented in science will be recruited to participate in multi-day field trips to sites of long-term environmental research, where they will meet scientists and learn firsthand about ecological research.  SEEDS will help these students and their mentors build and strengthen SEEDS chapters on their college campuses.  Students will be able to apply through SEEDS competitions for funds to support their own research and to attend the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America (ESA), where they can present their work and meet a wide diversity of ecologists. This suite of activities provides students with mentoring support and exposure to a broad spectrum of career development opportunities.   Effectiveness of these activities for recruiting students from underrepresented groups into the field of ecology will be assessed by independent evaluators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By expanding and fostering the interaction of students across ESA's members and partners, SEEDS is well-positioned to enhance the visibility and value of diversity for the next generation of scientists.  Through developing student leadership and community outreach skills, the project provides outlets for students to share the value of ecological science on campuses, in local schools and in communities.  More broadly, SEEDS helps to ensure a diverse workforce, which will be necessary to solve the many ecological problems faced by practically all societies in the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Diverse People for a Diverse Science  The SEEDS program &ndash; Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability  &ndash;  is the flagship Presidential award-winning education  program of the Ecological Society of America. Diverse People for a Diverse Science is the programÆs motto.  Through this award, SEEDS sponsored 75 undergraduate students from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds to three ecological field trips to field stations, one Leadership Meeting and the 2014 ESA Annual Meeting.  It also served the 2013-2014 cohort of three SEEDS Undergraduate Research Fellows.        Impacts of SEEDS  As part of the award, a formative and outcomes evaluation was conducted by independent evaluators from the Formative Evaluation Research Associates (FERA) team. The survey of students and alumni who participated in SEEDS programs between 2002&ndash;2013 was conducted in the fall of 2013.  Respondents included 61 current students and 161 alumni for a remarkably high 43% response rate.  The evaluation showed that about 85% of respondents came from minority populations and a vast majority 80%-90% felt that all the SEEDS core programs were valuable.  We also found that 40% of SEEDS alumni were in graduate programs at the time of the survey. An interesting outcome is that more than 80% of all respondents thought that SEEDS had an impact on their personal growth, and gained knowledge of the field, leadership skills, confidence and a sense of responsibility.  When asked about the development of new program activities, there was overwhelming response in support of longer term mentoring support, regional activities and a structured program that connects high school and undergraduate students to ecology related career pathways. Respondents also urged SEEDS to provide graduate level / early career programs and additional support for SEEDS chapters.     Value of Diversity  Project activities highlighted possibilities in research, careers, community engagement, and interactions where studentsÆ ideas were heard and valued.   Participants appreciated the broad range of research and career settings and options that they could explore.     The newly-launched regional fieldtrips allowed SEEDS to reach out to minority-serving institutions in the regions. They also intentionally attracted lower division students &ndash; most of whom had never had any field experience or visited a field station.      working with the researcher, doing it in the field People took the time to break down how research works and how ecology affects the world.   Comments from participants, Mountain Lake Biological Station field trip  More than the tools and field techniques, for many students, SEEDS provided the professional and peer support that they might not otherwise have.     The overwhelming love of my SEEDS community, and the genuine passion we all shared with the professionals. This community is my home, and I am forever thankful for all that SEEDS does for me.     2nd time SEEDS Participant, Trout Lake Field Station fieldtrip     I think the meeting encouraged me to just go get it. Before I felt like my life situation made some of this impossible but I met and saw many people who didn't let that stop them. Also, the community I felt with this group let me know I am not alone and I can count on others as I go forward.    Participant, 2014 ESA Annual Meeting  We are excited about the potential that SEEDS has not only to develop scientists but to develop leaders.  Students understood the importance of community engagement and nearly all the SEEDS Leadership Meeting participants expressed enthusiasm in engaging in outreach and educational activities in their own communities.  Over time, ESA is contributing to a new generation of leaders with the ability to connect ecological science with communities across the nation.
