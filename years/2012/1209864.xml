<AbstractNarration>This action funds Kevin Messenger of Alabama A &amp; M University to conduct a research project, entitled "Dietary preferences of Red-necked keelback snakes and the implications of using defensive toxins," during the summer of 2012 at Beijing Normal University in Beijing, Beijing Province, China. The host scientist is Dr. Zhang Zhengwang at Beijing Normal University, as well as Dr. Liang Wei and Dr. Shi Haitao of Hainan Normal University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is looking at the largely unknown genus of snakes known as Rhabdophis, which are one of the very few genera in the world that is both poisonous and venomous. Work on this genus is nearly non-existent with the exception of one species from the islands of Japan. Results contribute significantly to the understanding and evolutionary position of this little known, and unique genus.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

I searched for my target species for the 6 weeks the program in was in session, but at the same time working on a backup plan.
