<AbstractNarration>The collaborative team will take advantage of the currently funded Greenland Inland Traverse (GrIT) traveling between Thule and Summit Greenland to access a spatially diverse area of the GIS in order to better understand albedo variability and the snow properties that influence albedo. The GrIT route offers a unique opportunity to study a wide range of snow accumulation zones (i.e. the ablation zone, soaked snow zone, the percolation zone and the dry snow zone) across Greenland, which are expected to have a broad range of albedo values as well as significant variability in snow physical properties and concentrations of light absorbing compounds (i.e. dust, elemental carbon, and brown carbon). The project's field component will take place over two seasons during the spring of 2013 and 2014. The approach will include stopping along the traverse to collect coincident daily measurements of snow spectral albedo, snow physical properties (i.e. specific surface area, density), surface snow light absorption properties (i.e. wavelength dependent absorption of water soluble compounds and particulates), and the concentrations of trace elements, organic, and elemental carbon. Additionally, the temporal evolution of spectral albedo will be monitored continuously during the sunlit months using autonomous stations deployed along the traverse route to track seasonal variations of snow albedo and to help attribute these variations to the physical and chemical composition of the snow.  The results of this project will yield a unique data set characterizing the temporal and spatial variability of surface albedo as well as the physical and chemical properties of Greenland snow, which are broadly useful to both modeling, ice mass balance, and remote sensing communities. Conference presentations, rapid publication of results, and most importantly close collaboration with modelers, (i.e. through work with the CESM PCWG) will ensure that this knowledge used to improve process parameterizations in predictive global climate models.  The team will also build on international collaborations begun in the Dartmouth IGERT program, including a week-long ambassadorship to Nuuk by co-PI Polashenski including lectures at the college and Katuuaq cultural center.  Graduate, undergraduate, and high school student training will also be included in the project.</AbstractNarration>

Latent heat transport into the snowpack due to meltwater percolation drives the observed warming.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Sunlight Absorption across the Greenland Ice Sheet Experiment (SAGE) was funded under the NSF project "Collaborative research: Spatial and temporal variability of surface albedo and light absorbing chemical species in Greenland (Award# 1203876).  The goal of this work is to measure the spatial and temporal variability of the surface spectral albedo (how much snow reflects incident light of different "color") across the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and to quantify and partition the roles different physical processes play in contributing to that variability. Specifically, we are investigating the impact on surface snow albedo from snow grain size and microstructure, the deposition of black carbon, dust and other particulate matter, and wetness on the surface (caused by melting).  The SAGE project combined an extensive field, lab and modeling effort.  Laboratory analyses of snow samples from 67 sites collected as part of a two-year field effort represent the largest black carbon/dust/snow physical property data set collected to date, providing an unprecedented resource to validate signals from satellite-based instruments, including NASA?s MODIS instrument in particular.  Interpretation of the spatially distributed observations demonstrated that an apparent decline in albedo across the dry snow zone of the ice sheet from MODIS returns was not due to black carbon from biomass burning events or dust, as had been previously suggested, but was in fact an artifact of a degrading sensor.  Enhanced levels of BC from wildfires in summer 2012 were only found in a few pits, all near the summit of the ice sheet, calling into question published assertions that widespread darkening by soot from fires contributed to record melt over nearly the entire ice sheet that summer.  Black carbon concentrations from the pits and surface snow sampled in 2013 and 2014 indicate a complex depositional pattern, and present the most comprehensive and widely sampled study of coupled snow chemistry and physical properties including black carbon measurements in Greenland to date.  We have found that light absorbing aerosols over Greenland may be playing an important role, if relatively minor compared to other factors, in the radiation balance of the ice sheet, particularly in defining the spatial variability in snow albedo.
