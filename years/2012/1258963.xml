<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for attendees and invited speakers for the eleventh annual symposium of the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowships (AAPF) program, to be held in Long Beach, California, on 2013 January 5--6.  The purpose of the AAPF program is to integrate research and educational activities at the postdoctoral level to better prepare fellows for a scientific career.  The annual symposium provides a venue for fellows to discuss their research and teaching or outreach projects while increasing their exposure within the astronomy and astrophysics community.  The symposium represents a key component of the AAPF program and acts as a mechanism to facilitate knowledge transfer from experiences that the fellows have obtained in the course of their activities to a broad audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with previous symposia in this series, the AAPF symposium for 2013 will promote interactions among astronomers with very different interests and backgrounds.  By creating a forum in which discussions can occur across the standard boundaries defined by sub-discipline, there is great opportunity for new insights and the ability to develop new interdisciplinary collaborations.  The symposium will also provide a venue for discussing other issues that are important to early career astronomers.  In addition, the symposium will (1) provide a forum for discussing the combination of research and teaching, (2) facilitate collaborations between AAPF fellows on both research and education, and (3) provide exposure for the fellows and the fellowship program within the astronomical community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship (AAPF) program is a fellowship designed to integrate research and education at the postdoctoral level to better prepare its fellows for a scientific career.  The 11th Annual NSF AAPF Symposium, which was supported by this NSF award, provided a venue for current fellows to discuss their research and teaching or outreach projects while increasing their exposure within the astronomy and astrophysics community.   The 2013 NSF AAPF Symposium was held at the Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center in Long Beach California January 4-5, 2013, preceding the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society.  The Symposium brought together fellows, their faculty mentors, members of the NSF staff, prospective fellowship applicants, and other interested members of the astronomy and astrophysics community.   As in previous years, this yearÆs NSF AAPF Symposium provided (1) a venue for fellows to discuss their research and education projects, (2) exposure for the fellows and the fellowship program within the broader astronomy community, and (3) a venue for discussing issues that are important to early-career astronomers.  The NSF AAPF Symposium differs from most small meetings attended by astronomers in that it provides a unique forum for the discussion of the integration of research and teaching. The NSF AAPF fellowship program leads the field in simultaneously addressing the importance of both research and teaching in the careers of astronomers. Through invited keynote speeches and expert discussion panels, the Symposium fosters an active discussion of ways to improve the teaching of astronomy while also conducting top rate scientific research. This helps to further develop the educational expertise of the AAP Fellows, who will likely become future leaders in the community capable of advancing and implementing the best techniques in education and outreach. As in previous years, the 2013 NSF AAPF Symposium consisted of the following components:  multiple expert panels on special topics of interest to the fellows;  a keynote science talk by a well-known member of the field who has managed to effectively integrate research and teaching during his/her career;  an invited talk by a science education specialist, discussing cutting-edge methods in science education and outreach. talks by current fellows on their research and education or public outreach projects;    The 2013 Symposium included the following three expert panel discussions:     1. Making the Transition from Postdoc to Faculty   Prof. Allison Coil (UC San Diego)  Prof. Matt Povich (Cal Poly Pomona)  Prof. Danilo Marchesini (Tufts University)      2.  Project Leadership in the Age of Large Collaborations   Prof. Daniel Eisenstein (Harvard/CfA, SDSS-III)  Prof. Zejlko Ivezic (University of Washington, LSST)  Prof. Ted Dunham (Lowell Observatory, SOFIA)      3.  Novel Approaches to Public Outreach   Dr. Stuart Lynn (Zooniverse/Chicago Science Hack Day)  Prof. Kelle Cruz (Hunter College/CUNY/Astrobetter)  Dr. Curtis Wong (Microsoft Research/World Wide Telescope)    The 2013 Symposium science keynote talk, "Dark Energy and Cosmic Sound," was presented by Prof. Daniel Eisenstein (Harvard/CfA; Director of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III). The education and public outreach keynote talk, "Using Insights From Education Research to Build a Student-Centered Cosmology Curriculum," was presented by Prof. Kim Coble (Chicago State University). In addition, 19 current NSF AAPF fellows presented their latest work in research and education, and status reports from the NSF were provided by the AAPF Program Director Dr. Ed Ajhar and the Director of the NSFÆs Division of Astronomy Sciences, Dr. Jim Ulvestad. The symposiumÆs intellectual merit included promoting discussions among astronomers with very different interests and backgrounds.
