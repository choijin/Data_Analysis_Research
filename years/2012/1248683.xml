<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new approach to accurately predict coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Because high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) protects from CAD, current methods to assess risk measure the cholesterol content of HDL (HDL-C) as a surrogate indicator of HDL quantity. However, the function of HDL, namely its ability to efflux cholesterol, is what reduces CAD risk. Obesity and diabetes predispose to CAD and compromise HDL cholesterol efflux activity. Because direct quantification of cholesterol efflux activity is not amenable to clinical laboratories, we developed a novel assay that uses electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to report indirectly on HDL?s cholesterol efflux activity. Our assay is performed in approximately 10 minutes on less than 10 µl of blood plasma/serum and is suitable for routine automated, high throughput clinical use. The objectives are: 1) validate the EPR assay compared to direct measurement of HDL cholesterol efflux activity, and 2) determine the predictive power of our assay to identify dysfunctional HDL in an established cohort of individuals with type 2 diabetes (METSIM). It is expected that this assay will have superior sensitivity and predictive power over all existing methods to determine CAD risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable rapid assessment of HDL function and accurately predict CAD risk, a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity in the medical diagnostics and drug development space. This project will develop and validate a rapid, sensitive and accurate assay that reports on HDL function. This innovative (first-in-class), discontinuous (goes beyond HDL-C), and transformational assay (highly specific measurement of HDL function directly in plasma) can be used as a diagnostic assay to identify patients at risk, even those with normal HDL-C levels, and as a surrogate outcome measure in clinical trials and patient management. The exceptional capability of our assay to serve as a window on metabolic disease status in an age- and gender-independent fashion is unprecedented. This technology promises to greatly improve the early diagnosis of CAD and metabolic disease predisposition and facilitate the discovery and implementation of interventions to prevent disease and significantly reduce long-term healthcare costs. The still broader use of EPR spectroscopy to measure structural changes in proteins as functional biomarkers of disease represents a platform innovation that denotes a new era of sophistication for molecular diagnostics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The Importance of HDL Function  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US and the developed world. Epidemiologic data support a strong relationship between atherosclerosis (the most common form of CVD) with elevated LDL-cholesterol and reduced HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C). Non-invasive diagnosis of CVD risk (the likelihood of having a heart attack or stroke) remains a major challenge. Current blood tests to determine CVD risk measure the total amount of "good HDL." This provides a reasonable risk assessment across large populations, especially at low HDL-C levels, but does not accurately predict risk for all individuals, particularly those with normal-to-high HDL-C levels. HDL can be rendered dysfunctional and inflammatory, which compromises its ability to protect against CVD.  The realization that HDL function is a more accurate indicator of CVD risk than HDL quantity established a need for a new test. Dr. Michael Oda (ChildrenÆs Hospital Oakland Research Institute) developed the first patented and scalable assay of HDL function. The test, HDL Nexus, is an accurate in vitro diagnostic (IVD) that uses electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry to determine the rate of binding of a synthetic probe to HDL in a single drop of blood.

The test is also poised to deliver a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity to the medical diagnostics and drug development space.  Accent Assays was awarded an NSF SBIR grant to support validation of this novel test. In Phase I, the Nexus test was compared to the current gold standard of HDL function analysis, an expensive and laborious cell-based assay that requires radioactive tracers and has limited accuracy and throughput.  The important outcomes of this work include:     1.     Demonstration that the EPR test correlates well with the cell-based cholesterol efflux assay.     2.     The EPR function test is more indicative of CVD status than HDL-C levels and has the potential to reclassify patients currently not considered at risk or deemed at low risk.     3.     The Nexus test can detect dysfunctional HDL in subjects prior to and following a heart attack, which has important implications for early detection and interventions that can prevent and treat established disease.     4.     The EPR test appears particularly useful as an indicator of CVD risk in women, including individuals with normal HDL-C levels.     5.     Compromised HDL function, as measured by the EPR test, is a leading indicator of atherosclerotic plaque development (demonstrated in a rabbit model).   6.    The NSF-sponsored work was published in a peer-reviewed forum, the Public Library of ScienceÆs PLOS ONE (August 28, 2013).       7.     The company has established strategic partnerships with industry leaders including Bruker BioSpin (for EPR instrument development and sales), Cleveland HeartLab (for domestic distribution of clinical diagnostic services), and pharmaceutical companies committed to developing novel therapeutics for CVD (Bristol-Myers Squibb, CSL Behring, Roche, and Merck).    Broader Impact  Pharmaceutical companies are using the HDL Nexus test to validate new targets and test novel compounds to combat CVD. Doctors and clinicians will use it...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
