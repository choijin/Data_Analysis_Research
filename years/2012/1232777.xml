<AbstractNarration>For more than four decades, the Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium has been an annual conference designed to bring together geomorphologists from across the disciplines of geology, geography, and environmental engineering in order to enable them to exchange research results, become aware of new techniques, explore special themes, identify future opportunities, and enhance collaborative networks.  The 43rd Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium will be held in September 2012 at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  The theme of this symposium is the field tradition in geomorphology.  Participants will hear papers, view posters, and engage in field explorations as they reflect on the history of the discipline, acknowledge key contributions by a number of pioneering geomorphologists who have recently passed away, and consider the role of field work as researchers begin to tackle challenging, societally relevant questions involving climate change and sustainable management of the Earth system.  The conference proceedings will be published in a special volume of a leading journal.  NSF funding will provide support to facilitate the involvement of students and invited presenters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2012 Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium will provide a forum to honor the field tradition in geomorphology and explore its potential to help advance the field in the future.  It will facilitate greater cross-fertilization among research groups from different regions, and it will pass on the field tradition to the next generation of geomorphologists to early-career researchers and students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant from the National Science Foundation provided financial support for the 2012 Binghamton Symposium on "The Field Tradition in Geomorphology."  NSF funds covered expenses associated with organizing and conducting the conference and associated field trips, provided travel assistance for invited speakers and poster presenters, and subsidized the participation of graduate students and international participants.  The symposium was held September 21-23, 2012, in WyomingÆs Jackson Hole.  119 participants attended the conference, including 57 graduate students.   In keeping with the "Field Tradition" theme, the symposium featured two day-long field trips.  On the first trip, 60 people rafted down the Snake River in Grand Teton National Park, observing the dynamic geomorphology of this officially designated Wild and Scenic River and stopping at several key locations to discuss ongoing research related to river management, sediment transport, and remote sensing.  94 conference attendees joined the second trip, which involved traveling around greater Jackson Hole to view and discuss the tectonic context and complex glacial history of this remarkable landscape; distinguished USGS geologist Ken Pierce led the trip.   The on-site portion of the symposium consisted of a series of oral presentations and a poster session.  The opening keynote was delivered by Jack Vitek, who provided an entertaining and yet thought-provoking retrospective on the evolution of field work over the course of his illustrious career.  Invited oral presentations were made by eminent geomorphologists such as Mike Church, Ellen Wohl, and Carol Harden as well as mid-career (Josh Roering) and early career (Kimberly Meitzen) faculty.  Topics ranged from HardenÆs collection of lessons learned from decades of field studies conducted around the world to RoeringÆs commentary on the synergy between LiDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging)-derived topographic information and traditional field mapping.  Complementing the oral presentations was a set of 11 invited posters, contributed by workers in a number of sub-disciplines of geomorphology, from coastal to cold region geomorphology.  The range of topics was considerable, spanning both field investigations, such as HaschenburgerÆs study of the movement of tracer gravels over a period of 20 years, and more historical or philosophical perspectives, such as MontgomeryÆs "Faith in Floods: Field and Theory in Landscape Evolution before Geomorphology."  Finally, a total of 36 contributed posters, including 23 by graduate students, were presented at the symposium.   The intellectual merit of the 2012 BGS was threefold.  First, the symposium provided not only an opportunity to honor the field tradition in geomorphology but also a forum for discussing the future of the discipline.  More specifically, we sought to identify productive synergies between traditional field observation and new measurement and modeling technologies.  Second, the 2012 symposium continued the BGSÆs long tradition of contributing to the growth and development of geomorphology.  Third, papers presented at the meeting have been published in a special issue of Geomorphology, a major peer-reviewed journal, ensuring global dissemination of the conference proceedings.  Special issues from past BGS serve as valuable sources of information on specific themes within geomorphology and related disciplines; this type of influential publication is another tradition kept alive via the 2012 BGS.  The objectives of the 2012 BGS were to provide a venue to both reflect upon the field tradition in geomorphology and to discuss the added value of field work when used in combination with more advanced methods of data collection and analysis.  The conference thus fostered an introspective evaluation of geomorphologyÆs historical development, current status, and future prospects.  We believe that this assessment will help the geomorphic community to appreciate its scientific heri...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
