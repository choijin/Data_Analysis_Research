<AbstractNarration>Records of baseline ocean-atmosphere variability provide critical context for understanding changes in mean climate state. However, ocean?atmosphere variability is not well understood during the time between the anomalous Medieval Warm Period/Little Ice Age and the present (the last ~500-800 years). This project-- a collaboration between Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and Stanford University-- will develop a proxy record of variability in the western tropical Pacific over the past 500+ years. Coral cores collected from giant Porites colonies in Ta'u Island, American Samoa, will be analyzed for interannual- to centennial-scale variability in temperature and salinity (Sr/Ca and oxygen isotopes), indicating changes in the extent of the South Pacific Convergence Zone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will partner with the National Park of American Samoa to construct an exhibit illustrating the use of long coral cores to study environmental change. This exhibit, displayed at the park's information center, will include Ta'u coral core material and data associated with this study.  The project will support a post-doctoral researcher at Lamont and a graduate student at Stanford.</AbstractNarration>

We also sought to answer the questions: Is there a clear anthropogenic climate change signal visible in the American Samoa region?  X-rays of the coral core reveal continuous growth between the late 1490Æs and 2011 AD (the year we collected the cores). A long isotopic record shows a significant long period trend with the lowest d18O values generally concentrated in the most recent portion of the record. If interpreted solely as a change in SST the data indicates long-term warming of up to 3&deg;C at this site. However, we now know that the TaÆu coral record reflects a mixture of both sea surface temperature and salinity change. It also contains an interesting record of El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) variability.  Similar to LinsleyÆs previous coral records developed from Fiji and Tonga, annual variations in sea surface temperature dominate the annual coral isotopic cycle while interannual changes are influenced to a larger degree by salinity variability.  Over the last ~30 years there has been a close relationship between SPCZ movements and El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with the SPCZ shifting northeast during El Ni&ntilde;o events and southwest during La Ni&ntilde;a events.

This is evidence of a more southwesterly mean position of the SPCZ prior to 1927 when an abrupt regime change in the SPCZ response to El Ni&ntilde;o events occurred.  These results provide a useful view of natural climate variability in the South Pacific prior to the world average warming trend that began about 100 years ago. As such it provides a baseline of "what is normal" in a cooler world, a necessary part of being able to understand how the oceans are now changing. Our observations also have potential to imporve our understand of the many facets of El Nino/la nina variance in the Pacific Basin.    ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
