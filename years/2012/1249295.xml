<AbstractNarration>Dr. D. Sarah Stamps has been awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct research and develop a GPS geodesy education program while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This project aims to confirm and elucidate the origin of the dynamic processes driving rift-parallel surface deformation observed along the East African Rift, an archetype continental rift system. Dr. Stamps will (1) occupy geodetic benchmarks with Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments at previously measured sites along the Western Branch and Rukwa Rift where rift-parallel deformation is indicated, and (2) test candidate mechanisms for rift-parallel deformation using an adaptive finite element technique that can solve viscoelastic and time-dependent problems at various spatial scales. Verifying the existence of rift-parallel deformation along the East African Rift and determining the responsible mechanism(s) will provide a more complete understanding of rifting processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of GPS as a tool for monitoring active deformation is vital for advancing knowledge of seismic and volcanic hazards. This project supports the development of a GPS geodesy training program aimed at educating university students to observe millimeter precision surface motions with GPS. The pilot program will be implemented at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar and documented for future GPS geodesy capacity building efforts in developing countries and within the US.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: Along the East African Rift System (EARS), a region where the EarthÆs rigid outer shell (lithosphere) is actively extending, a peculiar pattern of surface motions was detected using high precision Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. Along the EARS where the continent extends East-West the GPS measurements show an approximately North-South motion. Similar "rift-parallel" motions may be characteristic of other active continental rifts along the EARS. Observations in the sub-surface from seismology, SKS-splitting, suggest mantle flow directions correlate with the enigmatic GPS observations. One of the outstanding challenges in the geosciences, and particularly geodynamics, is elucidating the degree which convecting mantle drives surface motions.  In this project the research comprises three major goals: (1) use high precision Global Positioning System instruments to measure surface motions along the Western branch of the EARS (Uganda and Tanzania) to determine if the anomalous rift-parallel surface motions are a system-wide phenomenon, (2) quantify surface motions and associated strain rates for regions of the EARS where rift-parallel deformation is detected, and (3) test the potential role of mantle flow as a mechanism for continental rift-parallel deformation using modern numerical methods.  Our new GPS observations along the Western branch provide evidence that rift-parallel surface motions are systematic in the northern regions of the EARS. We use these new data and existing GPS measurements to derive a new GPS velocity field for the EARS (Figure 1A) and quantify strain rates (Figure 1B).
