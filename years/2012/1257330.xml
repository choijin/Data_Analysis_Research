<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is a doctoral dissertation improvement grant. It supports research on the history of scientific and literary work in post-Enlightenment France with a focus on the normative conditions for acquiring knowledge that emerged as science and creative writing evolved into separate, autonomous pursuits. In particular, the award funds archival research on the letters of Pierre-Simon Laplace and manuscripts of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Archival research will serve to reveal their strategies for developing and promoting criteria for knowledge associated with the exact sciences and physiology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The works and correspondence of these two major scientists and public figures have not received due attention. These documents are pertinent to understanding the contentious character of the dispute involved in the process of mutual definition that made referring to literature and science as distinct fields possible in France. The project aims to show that the emergence of separate scientific and literary fields characteristic of modernity came at the price of networks that spanned an integrated cultural space. The project will involve methodological and theoretical innovations that facilitate relating both scientific and literary texts, and history of science and science studies methods in new ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical and methodological innovations to be implemented in this project should be applicable to a range of other historical contexts where the dynamics organizing competition and innovation are weak, decentralized or in flux. In addition to planned publications in professional journals, this innovative approach will be the subject of two academic seminars at UC-Berkeley, one focused on methodological concerns for discussion with literary and history of science scholars from Berkeley, and the other on integrating primary and secondary history of science texts into undergraduate curricula.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Today we recognize "science" and "literature" as distinct forms of cultural production, but in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries these categories had not yet emerged. Instead of "science" there were the "sciences," a collection of modes of studying Nature with different degrees of professionalization and institutional support, and instead of "literature" there were "letters," textual practices that included fiction, poetry and theater but also natural philosophy and other forms of knowledge-production. This project undertook archival research on two important scientific figures as part of an attempt to describe the process by which the sciences and letters differentiated into distinct forms of cultural production. The respective careers of the physicist, imperial Senator and peer Pierre-Simon Laplace and of the physiologist &Eacute;tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire illuminates this process in different ways, showing how it took place in both the exact sciences and the sciences of life (in an era preceding the invention of "biology"). The French case offers an important context for examining these changes, given the centrality of Paris to international savant networks during the Enlightenment and early nineteenth century, the preeminence of French savants in a range of fields during this period, and the wholehearted adoption by French scientific figures of a "Newtonian" orientation to scientific knowledge production, centered on the mathematization of universal natural "laws."      The archival research undertaken thanks to this NSF-funded grant focused on LaplaceÆs pursuit of imperial patronage and on early, unpublished writings by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Laplace's correspondence with his wife, Marie-Charlotte de Courty de Romanges, lady-in-waiting to Napoleon's sister, Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi, grand duchess of Tuscany, and his wife's own correspondence with Elisa Bonaparte reveal many elements of Laplace's attempts to curry favor with Napoleon Bonaparte. This element of the project revealed the extent to which Laplace relied on his wife's closeness to Napoleon's sister to maintain access to Napoleon himself, even when rifts appeared between Napoleon and his sister. Ultimately, it fleshes out Laplace's strategies for advancement within imperial patronage, much broader than straightforward reward for his scientific work.Though existing historiography often notes Laplace's titles and positions under the Empire without explaining what they were or how he got them, or implies that they constituted rewards for his scientific work, this archival research helps define a more historically and sociologically rigorous account of Laplace's career, one in which scientific work becomes part of a broader ambition to constitute a cultural and political elite. Scientific figures of the era themselves often deploy the figure of the "selfless savant" to hone a professional persona defined by a commitment to pure knowledge and an indifference to glory or remuneration, but the careers of Laplace and many of his contemporaries indicate the degree to which the pursuit of personal prestige entered into the construction of their careers.      The research on Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire centered on texts the physiologist composed at the time of his participation in Napoleon's Egypt Expedition. Geoffroy cites these texts much later, in the 1830s, when he breaks with the Parisian scientific establishment, including the professors of the Natural History Museum of Paris (Mus&eacute;um d'histoire naturelle) and the other members of the Acad&eacute;mie des sciences. A better knowledge of these manuscript texts offers an opportunity to define the values and concepts associated with a notion of the sciences of life that was ultimately sidelined by the official sciences associated with Laplace.     This archival research made possible the composition of "Chapter 2: Life and Exactitude in Post-Enlightenment Paris," a chapter in the co-PIÆs dissertati...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
