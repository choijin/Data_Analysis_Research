<AbstractNarration>The Pacific field cricket has been introduced to Hawaii, where it is subject to a parasitoid fly that finds its host by listening to the calling song of the male crickets and depositing larvae that burrow inside the cricket and eventually kill it.  This puts the cricket in a dilemma, because calling is his means to attract a mate, but also places him in danger.  In some Hawaiian populations, 50-90% of the male crickets now have a mutated wing that lacks the apparatus necessary for calling.  They are thus unable to call, which protects them from the fly, but they then face challenges attracting a mate.  This project examines the consequences of such extraordinarily rapid evolution (the change occurred over 16-20 generations) for the mating behavior of the crickets.  The hypothesis for the ability of this novel mutation to become established is that pre-existing behavioral plasticity has enabled the silent crickets to achieve reproductive success.  The mutation and its effects will be monitored in the field, and laboratory experiments will examine how early experience with the acoustic environment influences mating behavior.  During presentations to university students and the public this research provides a compelling introduction to many topics in evolutionary biology and animal behavior because it features familiar animals ? crickets ? in an attractive place ? Hawaii ? evading an unpleasant ?Alien?-like parasite via natural selection, which then places the males in a dilemma with regard to reproduction.</AbstractNarration>

The cricket and fly co-occur on three of the Hawaiian islands: Kauai, the Big Island of Hawaii, and Oahu.  Our research examines the outcome of such conflicting selection, and has been focused for this award on a recent development in the system, the rapid (fewer than 20 generations) establishment of a new mutant male type, called flatwing, that has modified wing structures and hence cannot call. Such individuals are protected from the fly, but have obvious difficulties in mate attraction. We suggested that the flatwings were able to become established despite their obvious disadvantage in mating because of pre-existing behavioral plasticity.  From the cricketsÆ perspective, the spread of the flatwings means that their world has become relatively silent.  But such silence could arise from other sources besides the appearance of a novel mutation, including low population density, a female-biased sex ratio, or poor local habitat quality.  Perhaps the crickets already possess flexible behavioral "rules of thumb", such as "when few conspecifics are heard, move toward a caller", that enable them to accommodate such environmental variation.  Such rules would have been available when the mutant wing morphology appeared, and hence enabled the flatwings to find mates.  In other words, the flatwings may be exposing heretofore under-appreciated plasticity in the behavior of the crickets, which like most insects have always been assumed to be automatons that cannot alter their behavior to suit the circumstances.  As part of this project, we developed mathematical models of the cricketÆs behavior. We found that the optimal behavior switched abruptly from calling to not calling, depending on the sex ratio, population density, and other features of the environment.
