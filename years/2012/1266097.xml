<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Marcetta Y. Darensbourg of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A &amp; M University will develop synthetic analogues of the iron- and nickel-containing active sites of hydrogen-processing biocatalysts known as Hydrogenases.  The PI's group reproduces almost precise structural models of the unique and illusive "rotated" structure found in the diiron hydrogenase, and displayed in the as-isolated, mixed-valent FeIIFeI state of the enzyme.  In depth analysis of the electronic structure of the models by Mössbauer, EPR (ENDOR), and computational chemistry stimulates the design of advanced biomimetics, and its ability to serve as hydrogen-evolving electrocatalysts will be screened by cyclic voltammetry.  Through continued collaborations, such catalysts will be analyzed for electronic structures and for applications to dye-sensitized photocatalysis. The PI's group is diverse and contributes to the annual Chemistry Open House, the Expanding Your Horizons program for 6th grade girls, and other outreach programs, such as NOBCChE.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a broad scope, this work addresses the role of hydrogen as an energy vector--in energy storage applications, and the need for sustainable catalysts in both the production and utilization of hydrogen.  The sustainable energy-related research area impacts society as a whole and represents cross-disciplinary and collaborative training opportunities for students.  The research inspires coworkers to gain a broad scientific knowledge base in chemistry, biology, spectroscopy, theory, etc., and to be ever alert for the universal language of science, chemistry in particular, for the solving of problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report      The development of synthetic analogues of hydrogenase enzyme active sites over the past two decades in our laboratories and around the world was promoted by the need for cheap, base-metal, sustainable (replacements for platinum) electrocatalysts for hydrogen production that might be linked to a renewable energy source, i.e., solar electrons.  Showing the way in Nature are the hydrogenases, masterpiece enzymes for hydrogen production and its use as an energy vector in hundreds of microorganisms.   An array of enzymatic and spectroscopic probes, crowned by modern protein X-ray diffraction technology, provide opportunities for structure-function analysis of the intricate H2-ase active site molecular machinery, perhaps more explicitly than in any other known catalyst, Figure 1.  Coupled with computational chemistry, the likelihood of generating robust, active hydrogen-producing molecular catalysts seems imminent. The focus on the diiron hydrogenase, [FeFe]-H2ase, active site in 2012/2013 in our laboratories was, as with other synthetic organometallic chemists, made possible by an easily accessible precursor that had several of the attributes of the active site, Figure 2.   Our major goal has been to explore and exploit the fundamental requirements needed to develop an electrocatalyst composed of the earth abundant metals that are found in the hydrogenase enzyme active sites, iron and nickel, obviating the need for expensive platinum in water splitting and in fuel cells.  As we worked in this field, we learned more and more about the biology, the biosynthesis and the intricacies that billions of years of evolution has built into natural organometallic-like catalysis.  We and our colleagues, and competitors, in this field developed foundations of a major branch of bioorganometallic chemistry, ca. 35 manuscripts resulted from this time.     We are chemists; we make molecules and we think about how individual atoms within them interact with each other and with their exterior environment.      Thus we have focused on attributes of synthetic analogues, of the diiron cluster of [FeFe]-H2ase, such as the simple  (&micro;-SCH2CH2CH2S)[Fe(CO)2L]2 , Figure 2.   As our studies unfolded, an amazing team assembled in Europe reported in 2014 that the synthetic (&micro;-SCH2NHCH2S)[Fe(CO)2CN]22- dianion could lose a CO and morph into the conformational isomer of the actual wildtype enzyme active site (eas) when inserted into proteins devoid of the 2-Fe subsite. Chemists were indeed on the right track for pursuit of the synthetic analogues; we concluded that evaluations of structural and electronic features of the synthetic analogues sans protein were even more promising. Our synthetic chemistry generated bimetallic complexes of iron and nickel, with understandable features that were fully characterized for connection into the electrochemistry via cyclic voltammetry and controlled potential coulometry for electrochemical hydrogen production.   All of the features that we have considered and worked on for comparison to the natural active site of [FeFe]-H2ase-- such as the flexibility of the diiron unit, the CO-ligand substitution reactions, H-bonding to cyanides, well-positioned pendant base, the instability of the "rotated structure" (which nevertheless led to "trophy" synthetic model complexes), the attached redox-active ligand, are now clear; however and disappointingly, only a fraction of activity is found for the synthetic analogues in the absence of the protein.      So--- we chemists continue in our attempts to make up for the protein matrix by human insight, ingenuity and chemical modifications.      The critical role of the pendant base for facile proton-hydride coupling was admirably shown in extensive development of Dubois? P2N2 ligands and nickel complexes.   Our goal was to focus on bimetallic complexes and extend the eas models to maintain certain features, such as the dithiolate-bridged or M2S2 butterfly cores, and diatomic ligands, and then manipulate the metals? first coordination sphere with redox active ligands, in particular Nitric Oxide.  A breakthrough came in 2013/14 in the guise of a nitrosylated diiron complex, Figure 3.  We reasoned that this complex could serve as a mimic of both the [NiFe]- and the [FeFe]-H2ase eas?s; the former as the N2S2 binding site can be viewed as a metallodithiolate ligand, which can also hold a nickel, and the latter as shown in the Figure 3, where the Fe(NO) portion is the Fe proximal to the 4Fe4S cluster, the redox-active NO serving as that redox-active component.  The Fe(NO)2 unit is an analogue of the Fe(CO)2CN unit, and can also be a redox-active unit.      Following our initial report of this nitrosyl-paradigm for storage of electrons within the complex, presuming that one of two metals will be hydride parking places, we developed a class of four proton-reduction, hydrogen evolving catalysts, Figure 4.  Computational analysis of potential mechanisms uncovered a required S-Fe bond breakage will produce a site for the proton to reside, and guide the H-P coupling process.  The role of the nitric oxide was to make the uptake of electrons, and their storage until needed, a more energetically accessible process.   Overall ca. 10 graduate, 10 undergraduate students and 3 post doctoral fellows worked on this project.          Last Modified: 12/26/2017       Submitted by: Marcetta Y Darensbourg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
