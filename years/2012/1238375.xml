<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;#1238375&lt;br/&gt;Raveche&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major objective of the proposed research is to employ advanced flow-cytometry-based instrumentation to develop methods and protocols for isolating distinct subpopulations of cells. This in-depth analysis of cell characterizations using fluorescence detection to distinguish 17 or more characteristics simultaneously on individual cells and employing multiple parameters to sort these populations while maintaining the viability of the cells will advance the employment of flow cytometers in biomedical research. The isolation and identification of the cancer progenitor cell is only recently feasible because the technology has evolved such that multiple fluorochromes excited by specific wavelengths emitted from several lasers and unique detectors can sort cells based on multiple markers simultaneously. This requires stable laser lines, careful compensation controls, defined fluidics and sensitive optics and detectors. The hypothesis to be tested is that based on identifiable characteristics, the earliest cancer progenitor cell in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can be identified.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, our collaboration via the NSF/SIR award has resulted in a manuscript accepted by Oncogene, a Nature journal and one of the leading high impact scientific journals in  cancer research. Another manuscript describing the effects of miR15a/16 on the ability of stem cells to develop in the B lineage pathway is being prepared for submission. We have been fully engaged in FDA activities, both offering our expertise and learning from the experts at OSEL/CDRH/FDA.  The Raveche lab attended Workshops on Minimal Residual Disease in CLL and an additional Workshop on Clinical Flow Cytometry in Hematologic Malignancies both of which took place at the FDA in February 2013.  Based on this, we have a better grasp of the unique aspects of regulatory work that faces the FDA and the role of cutting edge technology in the development of assays for diagnostics and monitoring new drugs being submitted to the FDA for approval. Based on RavecheÆs scientific expertise in microRNAs, she presented a talk:   "MicroRNAs: prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic implications" at OSEL/CDRH/FDA on Feb 28, 2013 which highlights the interest in microRNAs as emerging small regulatory molecules.   Intellectual Merit of the Proposal and the Effect on Science and Engineering:  During the initial period of funding, we have made progress in indentifying subpopulations of B cells in which the microRNA miR15a/16 is decreased.  The investigators in this proposal have been involved in identification of the precursor state of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and  flow cytometric sorting of this population demonstrated that microRNA miR15a/16 is selectively decreased in this population. These cells may be the important leukemia progenitor cells.  We have analyzed congenic mice in which the mutated miR15a/16 region has been introduced into control mouse strains.  The resultant mice have increased levels of B-1 cells and decreased miR15a/16.  This is an important verification of the role of the mutation on microRNA processing. We have shown that stem cells with increased levels of miR15a/16 preferentially give rise to B-2 cells, which do not develop into CLL.  This suggests that decreased miR15a/16 is a fundamental defect for the development of CLL.  We have begun two new collaborations both of which need more time to complete. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
