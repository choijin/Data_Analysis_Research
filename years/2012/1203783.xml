<AbstractNarration>Records of baseline ocean-atmosphere variability provide critical context for understanding changes in mean climate state. However, ocean-atmosphere variability is not well understood during the time between the anomalous Medieval Warm Period/Little Ice Age and the present (the last ~500-800 years). This project-- a collaboration between Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and Stanford University-- will develop a proxy record of variability in the western tropical Pacific over the past 500+ years. Coral cores collected from giant Porites colonies in Ta'u Island, American Samoa, will be analyzed for interannual- to centennial-scale variability in temperature and salinity (Sr/Ca and oxygen isotopes), indicating changes in the extent of the South Pacific Convergence Zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will partner with the National Park of American Samoa to construct an exhibit illustrating the use of long coral cores to study environmental change. This exhibit, displayed at the park's information center, will include Ta'u coral core material and data associated with this study. The project will support a post-doctoral researcher at Lamont and a graduate student at Stanford.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to measure oxygen isotopes back in time along the sequentially accreted carbonate skeleton preserved in a 6 meter long core from a Porites lutea coral colony from the Island of TaÆu in American Samoa. The coring site is located in the center of what is known as the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), a region of seasonally varying heavy rainfall in the South Pacific that is related to the global band of high tropical rainfall extending around the globe. Since coral oxygen isotope ratios we measured are known to be a function of water temperature and salinity, results from this coral will provide information about important hydrologic variability in the SPCZ and how it relates to the global convergence zone and to interannual El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the lower frequency Pacific Decadal Oscillation.  The final oxygen isotope record we generated from this coral consists of data from 5,160 individual measurements at near-monthly resolution spanning November 2011 to 1557 A.D.  From the comparison of expected coral oxygen isotopes modeled from instrumental sea surface temperature and salinity, it is clear that coral skeletal oxygen isotopes at TaÆu accurately tracks both local temperature and salinity. Similar to our previously generated coral oxygen isotope records from Fiji and Tonga, annual variations in sea surface temperature dominate the annual coral oxygen isotope cycle while interannual changes in coral oxygen isotopes are influenced to a larger degree by salinity variability.  Our TaÆu data indicate that over the last ~30 years there has been a close relationship between SPCZ movements and ENSO with the SPCZ shifting northeast during El Ni&ntilde;o events and southwest during La Ni&ntilde;a events. This SPCZ re-positioning results in more saline conditions on average in the Samoa region during El Ni&ntilde;o as the SPCZ shifts NE and the westward flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC) advects relatively salty water into the region. Our results show that this relationship between SPCZ position and El Ni&ntilde;o events existed back until 1927. Prior to 1927, the TaÆu coral oxygen isotope record contains distinct evidence that on average there were fresher conditions during El Ni&ntilde;o events in Samoa/American Samoa. This is evidence of a more southwesterly mean position of the SPCZ prior to 1927 when an abrupt regime change in the SPCZ response to El Ni&ntilde;o events occurred. The timing of this abrupt change in SPCZ position coincided with a change in North Atlantic SST as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) shifted from a negative to positive phase and the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) of high rainfall shifted north.  Our results from TaÆu suggest that the SPCZ central axis also shifted north in the mid-1920s indicating a coordinated ITCZ change in both the Atlantic and Pacific basins.  The longer record back to 1557 AD shows a large long-term trend towards lower oxygen isotope values in the 20th century relative to the past with a large step decrease on oxygen isotopes between 1803 and 1810. The cause of this trend and early 1800s step change are still under investigation and most likely are due to a warming and freshening of the surface ocean in the Samoa region. We plan to test other geochemical and physical tracers of temperature to evaluate the temperature component of this Samoa coral oxygen isotope trend to further quantify the magnitude of both warming and freshening in this region since the mid 1500s.
