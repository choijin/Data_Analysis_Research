<AbstractNarration>As science today grows increasingly digital, it poses exciting challenges and opportunities for researchers. Whether it is streaming data from sensors, simulating the formation of tornadoes, annotating and sharing tagged audio and video data, or using geographic information systems to anticipate the spread of disease, the frontiers of transformative science are enormous and continue to grow. Many scientists are turning to web portals or science gateways to allow them to analyze, share, and understand large volumes of data more effectively. The existence of science gateways - and the sophisticated cyberinfrastructure (CI) tools and resources behind these accessible web interfaces - can significantly improve the productivity of researchers facing the most difficult challenges. Most important, science gateways can democratize access to the cyberinfrastructure that enables cutting edge science. Now the best minds can tackle today¹s most challenging science problems, regardless of their affiliation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science gateway developers face several challenges. They often work in isolation even though development can be quite similar across domain areas, they bridge local, campus, national and sometimes international cyberinfrastructure, they need foundational building blocks so they can focus on higher-level grand-challenge functionality. Sustainable funding for science gateways can also be difficult to secure as they span the worlds of research and infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year planning award will gather community feedback, forming the foundation of a Science Gateway Institute. The institute will be an incubator of sorts for science gateways, vastly increasing their chances for long term success. It will provide a forum for developers to share ideas, approaches and software. It will provide expertise - in science gateway building, in technologies enabling grand challenge research, in open community software development, in virtual organizations, in project management and in science gateway sustainability. It will provide workforce development, training the next generation for careers in this dynamic, cross-disciplinary and important area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Workforce Development component of the Collaborative Research: The Science Gateway Institute (SGW-I) for the Democratization and Acceleration of Science grant has succeeded in identifying two underrepresented communities of future gateway designers and users.  The Association of Computer and Information Science/Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions (ADMI) has been identified as a source of future gateway designers.  The National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) has been identified as a community of future science gateway users.     Two professional development seminars were conducted during the 2013 and 2014 NOBCChE Conferences.  During the first seminar, Dr. Linda Hayden, along with Dr. Sudhakar Pamidighantam, presented information on the Science Gateways Institute and how it could support NOBCChE chemistry research .  Dr. Pamidighantam is senior Research Scientist at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and leads GridChem Science Gateway development.  Over 35 minority chemistry students and faculty from 14 universities along with industry leaders attended the leadership development workshop.     One undergraduate and three computational chemistry graduate student researchers were identified and made oral presentations during the 2014 NOBCChE conference.  Support was provided for the students through the WD SGI grant.  We have identified five additional graduate students for presentations at the 2015 NOBCChE conference.  The selection process included evaluating the potential of the research for development on a gateway platform.      With regards to ADMI, both a summer training for HBCU faculty and conference professional development seminars were conducted.  Dr. Richard Loft, Science Gateways steering committee member and researcher with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) presented an Introduction to Gateways/HubZero during the 2013 and 2014 conferences.  He returned in 2015 to discuss specific faculty opportunities with Raspberry Pi.  Three ADMI graduate students were invited to participate in the UCAR software engineering workshop.  This Software Engineering Conference (SEA) Hosted by University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) was intended as a forum for discussions of multiple aspects of software engineering.

Featured speakers included Dr. Michael McLennan of Purdue UniversityÆs Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, Dr. Rion Dooley of the Texas Advanced Computing Center, and Dr. Stephanie Barr of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  This workshop introduced participants to common uses of Science Gateway, highlighted several approaches to modern gateway design, and walked them through the process of building and customizing gateways science discipline using existing platforms.
