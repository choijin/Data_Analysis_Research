<AbstractNarration>The PIs will model the production, transport, and deposition of glacial sediments at the Alaska-Aleutian subducting margin during the last 125,000 years.  The Cordilleran Ice Sheet and crustal response to ice loading will be modeled using the University of Maine Ice Sheet Model (UMISM). USISM solutions will be related to existing sediment datasets and glacial power erosion laws to determine temporal and spatial patterns of erosion and sediment distribution. Suspended sediment samples and field measurements of rock strength will be collected and integrated with the modeling efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:The societal impacts of the study ultimately include a better understanding of earthquake hazards along this active margin.  The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students. Data and models will be simplified for online experimental learning modules targeted at K12/general audiences. Model results will be made available through the U Maine web server.</AbstractNarration>
