<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jingsong Zhang of the University of California at Riverside investigates the light-driven dissociation of polyatomic free radicals (photodissociation dynamics). Free radicals are important in many reactive environments such as combustion and atmospheric chemistry, and it is still challenging to understand their photochemistry, excited state dynamics, and nonadiabatic interactions. The goal of this project is to provide detailed information on the spectroscopy, structures, energetics, photochemical reactivity, and nonadiabatic dynamics (especially via conical intersections) of the benchmark polyatomic radicals with quantum accuracy. High resolution high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight spectrometry will be utilized as the main tool to study the spectroscopy and state-resolved photodissociation dynamics of reactive intermediates important in combustion and atmospheric chemistry. The systems to be examined include formyl radical, small diradicals, and alkyl radicals. These experimental studies can also provide stringent tests for high-level quantum mechanical theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Zhang will work closely with Professor C. Brazier and his students at California State University at Long Beach to enhance the research and educational activities at this Hispanic Serving Institute. Through this project, Professors Zhang and Brazier mentor graduate students to become community college teachers, collaborate with the current and future instructors, and share their knowledge with a highly diversified student population at Riverside and local community colleges that serve a large population of minority students will participate in the research during summer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This research program focuses on chemistry of free radicals.  Free radicals play dominant roles in many reactive environments (such as atmospheric chemistry and combustion).  Our research activities aim to provide fundamental understanding of free radical chemistry by exploring a broad range of important basic and practical scientific issues.  The photochemistry of several aromatic and cyclic radicals important in combustion have been investigated.  The systems include o-pyridyl, m-pyridyl, and cyclohexyl radical.  Both the o-pyridyl and m-pyridyl radical have a strong UV absorption in 220-270 nm due to excitation of the conjugate p system.  Both pyridyl radicals dissociate after the UV excitation via internal conversion of the electronically excited states, followed by unimolecular decomposition of the hot pyridyl radical on the ground electronic state.  H + cyanovinylacetylene are the main products in both radicals.  The UV excitation of the cyclohexyl radical involves a Rydberg state.  The dissociation mechanism is non-statistical, direct dissociation on a repulsive excited state surface or on the repulsive part of the ground state surface to produce H + cyclohexene.  This mechanism is similar to that of smaller alkyl radicals.  Cyclohexyl is the largest radical so far showing a direct dissociation mechanism.  The UV photodissociation dynamics of n-propyl and i-propyl radical via Rydberg states are studied.  The H + propene product translational energy and angular distributions of both propyls are bimodal.  Two dissociation pathways are involved: (i) a unimolecular dissociation from the hot ground-state propyl after internal conversion from the Rydberg states, and (ii) a direct, prompt dissociation coupling the Rydberg excited states to a repulsive part of the ground-state surface.  The UV photodissociation of allyl radical via the B, C, and E electronically excited states are also investigated.  The H-atom photofragment yield spectrum shows a broad peak near 228 nm, while the UV absorption spectrum peaks around 222 nm. This difference suggests that, in addition to H + C3H4, another dissociation channel (CH3 + C2H2) is significant with increasing excitation energy.  The H + C3H4 product translational energy release is small.  The dissociation mechanism is unimolecular decomposition of the hot allyl radical on the ground electronic state after internal conversion.  A dual-channel diode-laser spectrometer is developed by combining cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) with chemical amplification to measure atmospheric peroxy radicals (HO2 and RO2).  A detection sensitivity of 4 ppt/10 s has been achieved in ambient measurements.  This PERCA-CRDS instrument is compact and capable of providing real-time, in situ, and sensitive measurements of atmospheric peroxy radicals.  Thermal decomposition of benzyl radical, an important reactive intermediate in combustion, is examined.  The major decomposition products are H + C7H6 (fullvenallene), as well as cyclopentadienyl radical + acetylene.  The thermal decomposition of cyclohexane, a prototypical cyclic hydrocarbon fuel, is studied.  Ring opening via C-C bond scission to linear diradical C6H12 (hexane-1,6-yl) is the most competitive pathway. The diradical C6H12 then decomposes via three C-C bond rupture channels.  The thermal decomposition of several chemical vapor deposition (CVD) precursors have been examined.  The primary decomposition of tetramethylsilane (TMS) and tetramethylgermane (TMG) occur via loss of a methyl radical to form &bull;Si(CH3)3 and &bull;Ge(CH3)3, which then lose a second methyl to form :Si(CH3)2 and :Ge(CH3)2, respectively.  Another secondary decomposition process in TMS involving loss of H atom from &bull;Si(CH3)3 followed by elimination of H2 to form SiC3H8, SiC3H6, and SiC3H4 is identified.  The thermal decomposition of methyltrichlorosilane (CH3SiCl3), dimethyldichlorosilane (Si(CH3)2Cl2), and methyldichlorosilane (SiHCH3Cl2) are investigated.  The pyrolysis of CH3SiCl3 proceeds primarily via Si-C bond homolysis to form SiCl3 and methyl.  At elevated temperatures, SiCl2 production from secondary decomposition of SiCl3 becomes important.  The pyrolysis of Si(CH3)2Cl2 occurs mainly by sequential loss of methyl radicals, ultimately forming a significant amount of SiCl2.  The pyrolysis of SiHCH3Cl2 mainly undergoes sequential CH3 and H loss and/or molecular elimination of CH4 to form SiCl2.  SiCl2 is produced in significant concentrations in all the three molecules, indicating it as an important intermediate in CVD of chloroorganosilanes. The project provides opportunities to train both graduate and undergraduate students through the multi-disciplinary research activities.  Total nine graduate students (two women and one underrepresented minority) have participated in the research projects.  The research projects have helped further their education and develop their independent research skills.  The graduate students have coauthored research publications.  Two graduate students received their PhD degrees and one MS degree.  Several undergraduate research students from various STEM and minority training programs at UC Riverside have participated in the NSF projects.  They have enriched their undergraduate experience.  Three of them coauthored four papers and presented their work at several local undergraduate research conferences. This project also incorporates faculty members and undergraduate students from local undergraduate institutes and community colleges into the research activities.  The PI's lab has hosted a visiting professor from California State University at Long Beach for collaborative research and coauthored publications.
