<AbstractNarration>This action funds Ellenor J Brown of the Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a research project, entitled "Muscle Training Effects from Physical Interaction with a Wearable Robotic System," during the summer of 2012 at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) in Nara, Japan.  The host scientist is Dr. Tsukasa Ogasawara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to gain a better understanding of muscle coordination in healthy adults, information that may be useful for understanding  and rehabilitating muscle coordination disorders and for target muscle training for fitness and conditioning.  Muscle coordination is being monitored using an exoskeleton robot worn by the subjects.  The long-term goal of the project is to develop ways to predict and alter muscle coordination for a given movement task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Persons with movement disorders have difficulty with movement control, primarily due to diminished muscle coordination. In order to detect deviations from normal muscle coordination, scientists must be able to measure and predict muscle activity for a given task (e.g. holding a weight while the arm is in a certain position). The measurement can then be compared to normal values to find any differences.  The funded research conducted this past summer between Nara Institute of Science and Technology  (NAIST) and the National Institute of Fitness and Sports (NIFS) in Japan focused on testing a model of the right arm and torso muscles and improving upon methods to measure muscle activation. Previous research conducted in collaboration with NAIST, NIFS and the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) produced the muscle model.  The user specifies the position of the arm, a baseline condition with forces and moments applied at the hand, the muscles to be targeted, and how much the user wants the activation of the target muscles to change.  The program predicts which forces and moments to apply to the hand to make the specified muscle activation changes.  The past experiment used a wearable exoskeleton to control the joints of the wearers as they held a weight in their right hand. The subjectsÆ muscle activation was measured by using electromyography (EMG).  In the recent study, subjects held the handle of a robotic arm and resisted the movement of the handle.  The researchers measured EMG and took an ultrasound of the muscle in order to measure changes in muscle stiffness as the activation of the muscles changed. For this study, eleven healthy male subjects were recruited.  Subjects were asked to grasp the robotic handle and resist movement for twenty seconds. Subjects were asked to perform the baseline task and five other test cases.  The fellowÆs specific roles in the project included using the muscle model to select tasks and target muscles, developing a user-friendly graphical interface, and developing an algorithm for analysis of the ultrasound data. The muscle stiffness data was provided as a color-coded video. An image processing algorithm was created to read the data and distinguish between muscle and other tissues.  Data analysis for this study is not complete, though preliminary results suggest that the desired direction of muscle activation change (i.e. increase or decrease) was achieved with limited accuracy.  This research can have a number of contributions to science and medicine.  The ability to predict activation of individual muscles can be used to detect small deviations in muscle coordination that are caused by neuromuscular disorders.  This would enhance clinical detection and diagnosis of disease and allow for early detection. The availability of a robotic device would provide a reliable detection tool that is not subject to human factors such as the variability of skill level and experience among clinicians. In addition, the ability to control muscle activation could translate to more efficient muscle training for both rehabilitation and sports training.  Targeted muscle training could correct the loss of muscle strength or decrease imbalances in muscle strength that could lead to injury or decreased motor performance.  Through this experience, the fellow gained an introduction to both the culture and research environment of Japan.  This experience has increased the fellowÆs interest in pursuing future research collaborations, post-doctoral work or career opportunities in Japan and elsewhere. The research allowed the fellow to learn new methods for analyzing muscle activity, improved her ability to adapt to new environments, forced her to communicate effectively across knowledge and language barriers, and gave her a global prospective on the relevance of movement studies.
