<AbstractNarration>End-to-end high performance networking must continue to develop to keep pace with the computing ecosystem. While the community continues to make significant strides in high-performance computing, the ability to transfer the vast amounts of data generated by scientists has failed to increase commensurately. When scientists spend time dealing with data movement, or are limited by lack of timely access to data, the potential for scientific progress is hampered. Today, there are many application communities struggling with the well-known performance problems in TCP/IP in order to do the real work they need to do.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal would support the continued development and deployment of Phoebus, a protocol and service implementation for improving end-to-end transfers to gigabit speeds. Phoebus provides a network "inlay" that augments the network topology with an additional layer of protocol and functionality. Phoebus leverages the ubiquitous TCP/IPv4 implementation on the end hosts, while providing an adaptor to translate to a variety of alternate protocols over the wide area, including creation of virtual networks on the fly. Many data-intensive applications can use Phoebus without modification and without making any system-level changes.&lt;br/&gt;Phoebus makes use of a session-layer protocol called XSP, for eXtensible Session Protocol, for end-to-end communication and uses various transport layer protocol instances on different segments of the network, as appropriate. In many cases, performance can be improved by simply using existing protocols tuned based on network conditions and properties. Similarly, a high performance TCP alternative can be used when more assumptions about the underlying network can be made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phoebus is essentially a WAN accelerator for research and education networks. This project will work with various application communities to modify their software as necessary to make use of Phoebus and XSP. This will enable the creation of an automatically tuned data movement service, as well as the creation of appliances to act as "on-ramps" to dynamic circuit networks. Broader impact will therefore include significantly improved data transfer performance for scientific applications. Intellectual merit is found in the work's creative approach to adapting the concept of WAN acceleration to a multi-prototcol high bandwidth high delay environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcomes - OCI-1238379: STCI Net: Phoebus: An Integrated System for End-to-end High Performance Networking D. Martin Swany, Ezra D. Kissel, Indiana University   1 Outcomes Despite continuing advances in the link speeds of networks, data movement remains a key problem in many scientistÆs lives. In the era of Big Data, with increasingly distributed collaborative endeavors, moving and sharing significant amounts of data is critical. This is challenging for various reasons and many researchers still share data by shipping physical disks. Understanding this detriment to progress, the NSF has supported significant investments in network capacity for educational institutions. Yet even when there is ample infrastructure, it is not straightforward to manage high-throughput data transfers. The goal of the Phoebus project is to produce a system that eases this process for science users by automatically accelerating data movement. This project supported the development of Phoebus, a protocol and service implementation for improving end-to-end transfers to multi-gigabit speeds. Phoebus provides a network "inlay" that augments the network topology with an additional layer of protocol and functionality. Phoebus leverages the ubiquitous Internet protocol implementations on end systems, while providing an adaptor to translate to a variety of alternate protocols over the wide area, including creation of virtual networks on the fly. Many data-intensive applications can use Phoebus without modification and without making any system-level changes. This project explored, quantified and implemented various approaches to network acceleration. We produced and made available an open source implementation of a wide-area network accelerator system that can improve significantly throughput for applications. We produced a body of work studying our architecture, contributing to the understanding of wide-area network performance issues and solutions. We deployed Phoebus in the Internet2 network, the national research and education backbone that connects US universities, colleges and K-12 schools. Our testing and evaluation showed dramatic performance increases, even while using well-tuned applications that were already achieving good performance over the standard IP network. Bill Owens, a Director at NYSERNet, the research and education network in New York, noted "A physics researcher at Syracuse University has been able to increase his performance by over 10 times, reducing the time needed to transfer a dataset that is central to his research from 40 days to less than 4!" 2 Intellectual Merit The Phoebus project produced an open architecture for a network acceleration service, and a body of work studying its characteristics. The architecture is driven by features of networks, some that we have applied and some that we derived in the course of our work. The Phoebus approach contributes to the communityÆs body of knowledge, standing as an approach differing from the current state of the art. The "Science DMZ" model being adopted by much of the community suggests building loss-free network enclaves, and placing data transfer nodes in them. The Phoebus approach mitigates the effects of loss across existing campus networks and broadens the reach of advanced networks. At the other end of the spectrum, WAN acceleration devices are widely used in enterprise networks, but are vendor-specific and proprietary. We have designed an open, extensible architecture network services including our open-source accelerator. 3 Broader Impacts The impact of high-performance networking on both science and society is unquestionable and profound. In that sense, fundamental work in improving network performance and functionality has an impact. Further, we have produced a software artifact that has been used in various large-scale scientific collaborations including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, the CMS project in the Large Hadron Collider col...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
