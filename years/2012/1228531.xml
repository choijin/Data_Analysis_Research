<AbstractNarration>Is China pursuing a new model of regulatory development that relies more heavily on non-state forces?  This study seeks to highlight the important role that non-state regulators such as food producers,NGOs and producer associations can play in China's food safety system.  This project will examine how and to what extent non-state organizations complement the regulatory functions of the state; and, assess why some non-state regulators create, enforce, and transmit food safety norms more effectively in certain contexts.  This project draws on nine case studies compared across product type and geographical region, and a cross-sectional survey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of regulatory capacity in China has largely centered on the role of the state, emphasizing the effects of centralization or legislative design on regulatory outcomes.  As a result, the discussion of how to improve regulatory compliance has tended to overlook a key actor; non-state organizations.  The study of informal organizations and their role in regulation will make the following intellectual contributions.  First, this study will contribute to the literature on development, as it will show how and to what extent non-state regulation is possible in developing countries.  Second, this project will contribute to discussions concerning how to leverage public-private partnerships to improve governance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation will allow conclusions concerning how to improve food safety in multiple settings, and will focus on the development of new, and more effective, partnerships between the state and informal organizations to reduce the outbreak of major food poisonings.  Second, this project will discuss how international organizations can cooperate with indigenous non-state regulators to improve food safety outcomes.  Third, given the increasing trade in food between the United States and China, a study on food safety in China is essential to American public health.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research funding from the NSF enabled me to study non-state regulators and food safety in China, which has been embedded in my larger dissertation project, The Scale Problem: Food Safety, Scale Politics, and Coherence Deficits in China.   The dissertation considers how ChinaÆs scale has impeded effective food safety governance.  While references to ChinaÆs size, massive population, and complexity are commonplace, the concept of scale often hovers in the background of analyses, but rarely serves as a primary focus.  Whether they are harmonizing local best practices with transnational standards, coordinating actors in diverse, global supply chains, or navigating jurisdictional complexity, ChinaÆs regulators are engaged in a struggle to cope with the "consequences of giantism."  What type of politics emerge as regulators define problems, build institutions, and coordinate polices in a system that must direct over 240 million farmers and one million processors in a globalized market?          In contrast to studies that suggest poor governance outcomes in China result from bureaucratic fragmentation, my book highlights a contentious process of integrating a system that is multilevel and multi-dimensional in scale. I argue ChinaÆs system is poorly adapted to the needs of multilevel governance, which is why significant conflicts emerge as its food safety system tries to coordinate actors along spatial, jurisdictional, temporal, managerial, and knowledge-related scales.   I refer to this process as "scale politics": despite the felt need for an integrated governance solution, regulatorsÆ political commitments to particular food safety approaches lead to fierce disagreement about the type of system that should be built.       The project draws on over 170 interviews in nine geographically and economically diverse counties in China.  I engaged regulators, technical experts, corporate executives, and bodies responsible for setting global standards.  I also interviewed farmers in three food systems of different scale: the community-supported agriculture (CSA) market, the export sector, and the domestic market.  These interviews together with over 600-pages of internal state documents provide a broad view of food safety management that encompasses informal community governance, co-regulatory efforts, and command-and-control mechanisms.  My research on scale intersects with the literatures on regulatory governance and policy diffusion.  I find that successful community governance solutions based on social trust in the CSA market cannot always be scaled-up to serve as the basis for a national food safety system. Similarly, in the limited-scale export sector, I observe the ways that foreign governments and importers manage food safety through a strategy of adaptable direct control but, due to policy sinkhole effects and local politics, encounter problems when applying these same strategies in the domestic sector.  Regulators struggle to scale-down global best practices and to integrate local knowledge and local actors.  Because many of these challenges of scaling-up and scaling-down policies are not limited to China or to food safety, the book will also have lessons relevant to the research of a broader community of scholars who study policy diffusion and multilevel governance in the EU, India, and the US.      My book project engages a debate on the merits of incremental versus comprehensive policy reform by showing how the scale of a system precludes certain approaches. For food safety in the large-scale domestic sector, I argue that the entire system must undergo coordinated, comprehensive reform otherwise no gains will be realized.  First, I explore the ad-hoc promotion of new food production models to ensure food safety, including farmersÆ cooperatives, and vertically-integrated agro-processors.  I show that due to a lack of a comprehensive plan, supporters of these models have come into conflict with one another to the detriment of re...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
