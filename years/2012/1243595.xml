<AbstractNarration>The United States Universities Council on Geotechnical Education and Research (USUCGER) will hold an Early Career Geotechnical Engineering Conference on 8 July 2012 in Boston, Massachusetts, in conjunction with NSF's Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Engineering Research and Innovation Conference. This award is for the planning and facilitating this Early Career Geotechnical Engineering Conference which will be the first of its kind for the Geotechnical Engineering research community in several respects.  First, the Conference is aimed at addressing issues of importance to early career faculty.  Next, the Conference includes an explicit focus on facilitating research connections between participants.  This Early Career Conference will provide an opportunity for early career geotechnical engineering faculty to learn of on-going research under the direction of other early career faculty, meet geotechnical engineering faculty at other institutions to facilitate collaborations, and learn of federal funding opportunities for their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Early Career Conference seeks to enhance the diversity of participation by supporting early career faculty through stipends to attend the conference and to stay for the NSF CMMI conference.  The Conference will also provide keynote speakers representative of the diversity in geotechnical engineering. By focusing on Early Career Faculty where the demographics are more diverse than later career faculty, the participants will be provided tools and guidance that will no doubt enhance their probability of success in Geotechnical Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
