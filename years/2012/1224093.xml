<AbstractNarration>The Science Source Pathways Project will conduct initial work designing and testing a new model for providing news on STEM related topics to the rural and Native American communities in Montana. This project will enhance understanding of how the communication of scientific research reaches and impacts underrepresented audiences. A collaborative model will be developed between the environmental journalism program at the University of Montana and various local television, radio, and online media outlets that are either operated by or reach Native Americans on reservations and throughout the state.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project deliverables include a survey and analysis of current science reporting reaching this audience; and production and testing of prototype science news stories for dissemination on various platforms (print, radio, TV, web).  The development of science news pieces will be led by graduate students in the School of Journalism under the careful guidance and mentorship of experienced professors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance the communication and amount of STEM content delivered to underserved groups, and provide diverse opportunities for them to engage in STEM related environmental issues that affect their local communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             News is an essential element in civic engagement, creating knowledge and fostering communication about the issues important to our communities. With so much of Montana facing significant decisions about natural resources &ndash; decisions that can influence water quality, land use, and our global environment for decades and even centuries to come &ndash; having access to accurate information about the intersection of science, policy and the environment is critical. Local news may be especially important for reaching some audiences. In the current news climate, however, local news organizations have been cutting back on reporters, especially those with specialty "beats," such as environmental science, so that few news outlets offer coverage of this important topic.              In MontanaÆs remote, sparsely populated regions, few opportunities exist to engage with science outside of school. The internet &ndash; when it is available &ndash; offers as much misinformation as information about science, and audiences may be more influenced by friends and family than by scientifically credible content.

Science Source also produced a radio package aired by KGVA on the Fort Belknap Reservation &ndash; Montana's first and only Native radio station.              Science Source covered topics as diverse as GMOs to glaciers, and wildfire to wildlife, providing understanding and insight that comes from experience reporting on science for general audiences. When the discovery of a new species of sculpin was announced, we took a unique approach to the story, explaining the underlying genetics and the scientific sleuthing necessary to decipher what a species really is. When wild bison returned to the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, science mixed with policy, the law, public fears, and history. We used the conservation of this ancient species as a ba...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
