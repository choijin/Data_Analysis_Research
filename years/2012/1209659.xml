<AbstractNarration>Males often compete for the opportunity to mate; in promiscuous species, this battle continues after mating, as sperm compete to fertilize eggs, thereby driving the rapid evolution of male reproductive characteristics. This study will use a genetic cross between two species of deer mouse, one promiscuous and one monogamous species, to answer two critical questions: (a) which traits contribute to sperm competition success? and (b) which genetic regions are responsible for these traits? By competing mice with different reproductive characteristics in fertilization contests, and by identifying associations between these characteristics and specific genomic regions, this work will identify the traits and genes molded by sperm competition. This novel study will first ascertain which traits are subject to this critical evolutionary force, and then determine their genetic basis.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In conjunction with the project will be public outreach efforts, including the design and implement of an eight-week curriculum on adaptation for students in grades four and five at a Boys &amp; Girls Club in Somerville, Massachusetts.  The majority of students in this club come from low-income families in an underserved community. The project will also include mentoring of undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background  Competition amongst males to reproduce has led to the existence of beautiful and bizarre traits such as giant antlers, intricate feather patterning, and complex behavioral rituals. Because females from most animal species are promiscuous, this competition can continue even after mating, as the sperm of multiple males race to fertilize femalesÆ limited eggs. Such sperm competition is ubiquitous and drives rapid adaptation and the appearance of new species. However, we know little about a) which physical traits of sperm make for winners, or b) which genes underlie these traits.  In this project, we studied two closely related species of wild mice (Genus Peromyscus) that differ in their levels of sperm competition: in one, females and males are monogamous (no sperm competition), but in the other, females are highly promiscuous, (rampant sperm competition). Preliminary data showed that, as expected, males of the promiscuous species had faster sperm, but it was not clear what specific aspects of sperm anatomy and physiology might be relevant to speed, or which genes might shape these traits.

Then, by studying the association of specific sperm traits with sperm speed and competitiveness in these offspring, we determined that the length of a particular portion of the sperm, the midpiece, is important to sperm success in competition. Next, by studying the association of hybridsÆ sperm midpiece length with the segments of the genome inherited from the promiscuous or monogamous parent species, we were able to precisely locate a single genetic region responsible for controlling much of the difference in midpiece length between species. In this region exists a gene, Prkar1a, that we believe underlies the adaptation of sperm midpiece length (and thereby, sperm competitiveness) in these mice. Importantly, human men with mutations in this gene suffer from severely reduced fertility as well.  We have begun to study Prkar1a in the two species of mouse to determine how it might produce an effect on sperm midpiece length, sequencing the gene and measuring levels of RNA and protein in testis and sperm tissues from each species and their hybrids using a variety of techniques. We have also studied lab mice with a mutation in Prkar1a and confirmed that these animals, too, have differences in sperm midpiece length from their normal counterparts.
