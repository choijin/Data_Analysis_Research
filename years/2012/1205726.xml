<AbstractNarration>There is growing global importance of ocean exploration and monitoring as the oceans play a major role in climate regulation, nutrient production, resource retrieval and transportation, etc. Building and deploying a real-time underwater networked sensing infrastructure is thus needed for desired levels of monitoring and data collection. Despite a wave of research efforts in the area of underwater wireless networks, the lack of a community testbed has so far hampered further advances, as there is no common platform to evaluate and compare various communication and networking algorithms and protocols. Furthermore very few studies can afford to consider real system features due to the high cost of system deployment and maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the design and deployment of an open underwater testbed suite, accessible to the public at four sites in Connecticut, California, Texas, and Washington States. The testbed will include flexible choices of surface nodes, bottom nodes, and mobile nodes with reconfigurable modems. It will enable the vision of remote controlled and continuous networked node deployments running tests of communication, networking, sensing, and data streaming. In addition, the testbed will enable oceanographers to study scientific research questions, while using the testbed as a prototype for larger real-time monitoring deployments elsewhere. The testbed will also directly impact undergraduate research and student diversity by involving undergraduate students through REU programs, impacting curriculum development by enabling field courses, and engaging K-12 students and teachers, particularly in underserved communities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall goal of this NSF Award project is to develop an open testbed &ldquo;suite&rdquo; accessible to the public. It consists of four testbeds to be deployed at four different sites, namely, Long Island Sound (CT), Hood Canal (WA), Santa Monica Bay (CA), and Galveston Bay (TX), which will have a diverse coverage of the US coasts in terms of geography and weather. It will enable a wide range of research within the underwater communications, networking, engineering, and marine science communities.</p> <p>Being supported by this NSF project&nbsp;award, we established the underwater acoustic network testbed with three acoustic OFDM modems systems manufactured by AquaSeNT. We implemented the end users to transmit their own files (e.g., images/figures) across the modems and hydrophones to satisfy their transmission delay QoS requirements. Using this testbed, we developed the power allocations and network nodes cooperation schemes for the underwater acoustic wireless networks, which aim at reducing the energy consumption while guaranteeing the QoS requirements of users. These schemes include: (1) direct or relay transmission selections for underwater wireless networks, (2) optimal transmit power allocations for the OFDM acoustic modems. We completed the transport-layer protocols developments and parameter designs. We analyzed our testing results and compared them with the other collaborative institutes&rsquo; results under the same experimental conditions. Four institutes had bi-week meeting over Skype to report project progress and discussed experimental challenges.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our major a<span>ctivities include the followings. (1)&nbsp;</span>Transmit Relay Selection Schemes for Cooperative Communication Based MIMO-OFDM Underwater Wireless Networks. We conducted researches on how to integrate the cooperative communications, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques to improve the performances of underwater acoustic networks. (2)&nbsp;Statistical QoS-Driven Power Allocation Schemes for Acoustic Underwater Wireless Networks.&nbsp;In order to guarantee the multimedia transmission for time-sensitive traffics, we developed the effective delay-bounded quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee technique for power allocation scheme over acoustic underwater networks. (3)&nbsp;Upgrading of our underwater testbed in supporting data file transmissions for high-quality of multimedia data services over underwater acoustic networks.&nbsp;Multimedia data transmissions over underwater acoustic wireless networks have always been a challenging and open problem when considering the slow sound propagation delay (~15000 m/s, which is around 105 times slower than RF signal) over underwater acoustic channels. We focus on implementing feasible underwater image/video transmission schemes to minimize the propagation delay and maximize the average throughput over underwater acoustic networks. (4)&nbsp;Cross-layer algorithm and protocol design to improve the physical resource allocation strategies under joint statistical delay-bounded QoS/QoE guarantees over underwater acoustic networks. In order to tackle the severe fading problems over underwater communication environments, we design the cross-layer resource allocation optimization schemes over underwater acoustic networks, which enables the efficient use of the scarce resources such as bandwidth and energy while guaranteeing the statistical delay-bounded QoS requirements and improving the quality of user experience (QoE) over the underwater wireless channels. (5)&nbsp;Development of heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS/QoE provisionings in supporting the energy-efficient multi-hop relaying based communications over underwater acoustic networks. We develop the new heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS/QoE provisioning architectures for collaborative communications over multi-hop relaying based underwater acoustic networks. (6)&nbsp;Collaboratively working with another three universities to integrate TAMU&rsquo;s proposed cross-layer design/optimization system models into the high-layer protocols over underwater acoustic wireless networks. Taking the advantages of the complementary expertise among the four universities, our team at TAMU closely collaborates with another three university teams to develop the cross-layer optimization based underwater testbeds. (7)&nbsp;&nbsp;Deploying the&nbsp;Ocean-TUNE Testbed Offshore on Galveston Bay, TX.&nbsp;We conduct the offshore experiment at Galveston Bay to accomplish the overall goal of this project: setting up a realistic, larger scale, and longer-distance underwater acoustic wireless network testbed in the actual ocean environments.&nbsp;</p> <p>During the supporting period for this NSF Award Project, we have published 1 book chapter, more than 30 IEEE/ACM top-rating Transactions and Journal papers, more than 110 IEEE/ACM flagship conference papers. <span>In summary, under this NSF award support, we have produced totally more than 140 high-quality research papers in the top-rate IEEE/ACM Transactions/Journals and conferences, among which w</span>e also received 2 IEEE Best Paper Awards and 1 IEEE Best Readings Paper (receiving the highestcitation rate among all IEEE Transactions/Journal papers in the area) for one of&nbsp;IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications papers.&nbsp;</p> <p><span>Besides the technical merit, this project will also have a broad impact on mobile wireless networks for both education and industry in the following way. The developed underwater wireless networks architectures, schemes, and websites will effectively enhance not only the state-of-art networking technologies in industry, but also the networking-education quality. Therefore, we have developed one new undergraduate course (ECEN423) and its corresponding course labs specifically focusing on mobile wireless network modeling, designs, and analyses, which provides the students with the effective venues to learn how to apply and connect theory with the practical systems/protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong></strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/16/2018<br>      Modified by: Xi&nbsp;Zhang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967055144_indoortestbed2_words--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967055144_indoortestbed2_words--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The AquaSeNT OFDM Modems Based Underwater Testbed Deployed in Lab"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967055144_indoortestbed2_words--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The AquaSeNT OFDM Modems Based Underwater Testbed Deployed in Lab"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The AquaSeNT OFDM Modems Based Underwater Testbed Deployed in Lab</div> <div class="imageCredit">1</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xi&nbsp;Zhang</div> <div class="imageTitle">The AquaSeNT OFDM Modems Based Underwater Testbed Deployed in Lab</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967336016_bridge_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967336016_bridge_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The OFDM Testbed Deployment at Galveston Bay, TX 77554"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967336016_bridge_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The OFDM Testbed Deployment at Galveston Bay, TX 77554"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The OFDM Testbed Deployment at Galveston Bay, TX 77554</div> <div class="imageCredit">2</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xi&nbsp;Zhang</div> <div class="imageTitle">The OFDM Testbed Deployment at Galveston Bay, TX 77554</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967546415_testbed--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967546415_testbed--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The overall testbed architecture of Ocean-TUNE TAMU testbed with lab hydrophones and AquaSeNT OFDM modems deployed in Galveston Bay, TX"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967546415_testbed--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The overall testbed architecture of Ocean-TUNE TAMU testbed with lab hydrophones and AquaSeNT OFDM modems deployed in Galveston Bay, TX"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The overall testbed architecture of Ocean-TUNE TAMU testbed with lab hydrophones and AquaSeNT OFDM modems deployed in Galveston Bay, TX</div> <div class="imageCredit">3</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xi&nbsp;Zhang</div> <div class="imageTitle">The overall testbed architecture of Ocean-TUNE TAMU testbed with lab hydrophones and AquaSeNT OFDM modems deployed in Galveston Bay, TX</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967960739_Throughput3D_Big--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967960739_Throughput3D_Big--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The maximum throughput of Ocean-TUNE TAMU underwater testbed under different packet generation rates and packet lengths in real ocean environment."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1205726/1205726_10179700_1536967960739_Throughput3D_Big--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The maximum throughput of Ocean-TUNE TAMU underwater testbed under different packet generation rates and packet lengths in real ocean environment."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The maximum throughput of Ocean-TUNE TAMU underwater testbed under different packet generation rates and packet lengths in real ocean environment.</div> <div class="imageCredit">5</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xi&nbsp;Zhang</div> <div class="imageTitle">The maximum throughput of Ocean-TUNE TAMU underwater testbed under different packet generation rates and packet lengths in real ocean environment.</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
