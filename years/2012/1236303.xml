<AbstractNarration>1236303&lt;br/&gt;Dodd&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free available chlorine (FAC) remains the most widely used disinfectant in drinking water practice worldwide. It is cheap, easily utilized as a disinfectant, portable, and in general highly effective for achieving the inactivation of a wide variety of waterborne microbial pathogens. However, it is known to be relatively ineffective as a primary disinfectant of such important pathogenic agents as Cryptosporidium parvum, Mycobacterium avium, and Giardia lamblia, This has led to widespread adoption of more effective, but often substantially more capital-, equipment-, and energy-intensive alternative disinfectants such as UV light and ozone. Recent findings suggest that inactivation of chlorine-recalcitrant microbial pathogens may actually be achievable at considerably lower expense by utilizing sunlight or monochromatic UV light to photolyze FAC to such highly-reactive oxidant species as hydroxyl radical, atomic oxygen, and ozone during conventional chlorination. In such an approach, FAC and photochemically-generated oxidants may act in tandem to yield substantially greater inactivation of various waterborne pathogens than would be achievable using chlorine alone. This investigation will utilize a combination of chemical and microbiological tools to quantify inactivation of chlorine-resistant viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens during conventional chlorination processes enhanced by FAC photolysis. The primary objective of this work will be to evaluate the use of sunlight for photochemical enhancement of chlorination processes. However, the investigation will also focus on potential applications of monochromatic and polychromatic UV light sources, on account of their growing frequency of application in drinking water treatment. The project team will develop and optimize experimental and analytical procedures for quantifying pathogen inactivation during photochemically-enhanced chlorination by first utilizing two common surrogates for waterborne pathogens B. subtilis spores and MS2 bacteriophage, followed by the chlorine-resistant human pathogens M. avium, Coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5), and C. parvum. These procedures will subsequently be utilized to examine the influence of such critical parameters as pH, water temperature, alkalinity, and matrix oxidant demand on inactivation efficiency for each pathogen under simulated sunlight, natural sunlight, and various artificial UV light sources in buffered laboratory reagent water systems, as well as in real water matrixes acquired from municipal water utilities in the Puget Sound region. Particular emphasis will be placed on development of kinetic models for pathogen inactivation that take into account measured water quality parameters and spectral irradiance data. Finally, formation potentials of organic and inorganic DBPs likely to be generated during application of photochemically-enhanced chlorination (e.g., trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, ClO3-, ClO4-, and BrO3-) will be quantified under a variety of scenarios relevant to full-scale application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to establishing a theoretical framework for modeling chlorine-resistant pathogen inactivation during photochemically-enhanced chlorination, this project will provide an extensive dataset for M. avium, CVB5, and C. parvum inactivation under a wide variety of conditions applicable to full-scale water treatment (including variable irradiation wavelength, intensity, temperature, pH, and alkalinity). This research could support the photochemical augmentation of conventional drinking water chlorination processes at full-scale, with minimal equipment and process retrofit. Application of such an approach could have substantial benefits over existing alternatives to chlorine-based disinfection processes. First, chlorination is used in the vast majority of water treatment facilities. Second, utilization of solar radiation in particular as a light source could net significant cost and energy savings in comparison to processes utilizing ozone or artificial UV light. In addition, if a UV process is already in place at a facility, that process could quite easily be adapted for photochemically-enhanced chlorination simply by dosing FAC upstream of the UV reactor(s). Furthermore, sunlight-enhanced chlorination could prove exceptionally useful for ensuring disinfection of chlorine-resistant pathogens during point-of-use applications in developed and developing societies, on account of its expected low costs and ease of implementation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Free available chlorine (FAC) remains widely utilized as a disinfectant in water treatment due to its low cost, ease of use, and generally high efficacy. However, certain microorganisms (e.g., bacterial endospores, <em>Cryptosporidium </em>spp. oocysts<em>, Giardia </em>spp. cysts, <em>Mycobacteria</em>) exhibit considerable chlorine-resistance. This project has demonstrated that the effectiveness of chlorine-based disinfection processes can be significantly improved by employing sunlight-driven chlorine photolysis to generate the potent oxidants hydroxyl radical (<sup>&bull;</sup>OH) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) <em>in situ</em> (Figure 1). This approach was found to accelerate the inactivation of various chlorine-resistant microorganisms, including <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> endospores, <em>C. parvum</em> oocysts, <em>M. avium</em>, and Coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5). For example, the cumulative FAC exposure (<em>CT</em><sub>FAC</sub>, in mg/L*min) required to achieve 99% (2-log<sub>10</sub>) inactivation of <em>B. subtilis</em> endospores could be lowered by more than two-thirds by exposing an initial 8 mg/L concentration of FAC to continuous solar irradiation at pH 8 and 10 &deg;C (Figure 1). No spore inactivation was observed during exposure to equivalent levels of solar irradiation in the absence of FAC. Solar chlorine photolysis was found to yield roughly 90% (1-log<sub>10</sub>) inactivation of <em>C. parvum</em> oocysts under similar conditions, though this could be increased to as much as 99.9% (3-log<sub>10</sub>) by doubling irradiation time from 60 to 120 minutes (with a corresponding doubling of <em>CT</em><sub>FAC</sub>). Only ~1/4 of the observed oocyst inactivation was attributable to direct inactivation by sunlight, and no inactivation of oocysts was observed during exposure to FAC alone. The enhancement effects observed during solar chlorine photolysis were found to be attributable to varying degrees to a combination of (a) direct inactivation by O<sub>3</sub> and/or FAC, and (b) sensitization of microbes to FAC and/or O<sub>3</sub> by co-exposure to O<sub>3</sub> and hydroxyl radical (<sup>&bull;</sup>OH), respectively.</p> <p>This work has led to the generation and compilation of an extensive dataset of rate constants and treatment requirements for achieving inactivation of <em>B. subtilis</em> spores, <em>C. parvum</em> oocysts, <em>M. avium</em>, and CVB5 by solar chlorine photolysis under a wide variety of conditions (including variable solar irradiance, temperature, pH, chlorine concentrations, oxygen concentrations, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations). On the basis of these data, a coupled photochemical/disinfection model was developed to enable prediction of O<sub>3</sub> and <sup>&bull;</sup>OH formation and consequent microbial inactivation during FAC photolysis, then validated using experimental measurements of oxidant concentrations and <em>B. subtilis</em> spore, <em>C. parvum</em> oocyst, and <em>M. avium</em> inactivation rates during treatment under various solution conditions.</p> <p>Additional work by the project team showed that &ndash; compared to dark chlorination &ndash; solar photolysis of FAC in reagent waters or natural water samples generally led to higher yields of organic and inorganic disinfection byproducts &ndash; including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), chlorate (ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>) and bromate (BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>), with DBP yields increasing with irradiation time. This appears to be due to modifications of DOM by O<sub>3</sub>, ROS, and/or RHS (predisposing precursor materials to higher DBP formation in reactions with FAC), as well as direct formation of DBPs through reactions of precursors with O<sub>3</sub>, ROS, and/or RHS (Figure 2). However, experiments undertaken over a wide range of water chemistries illustrated that under appropriate conditions (e.g., moderate dissolved organic carbon levels, low bromide levels, low carbonate levels), DBP yields could be maintained at or below regulatory limits. Formation of chlorite (ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>) was only observed under select conditions in the absence of oxygen, while perchlorate (ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>) was not observed under any conditions.</p> <p>Research findings from the project have been communicated to technical and non-technical audiences through peer-reviewed publications in leading journals, oral and poster presentations at international conferences, and outreach to the public through regular K-8 open house events hosted by the UW College of Engineering (see Figure 3 for open house photos).</p> <p>Overall, this work could have important implications for disinfection practice in low-resource settings. For example, the combination of chlorination with the widely accessible practice of solar disinfection (SODIS &ndash; typically applied in UVA-transparent plastic bottles) could provide a simple, practical means of improving inactivation of chlorine-resistant waterborne pathogens such as <em>Cryptosporidium</em> oocysts and <em>Giardia</em> cysts in point-of-use treatment (Figure 4). The project findings could also have significant implications for preventing disease transmission in chlorinated outdoor swimming pools, as a large proportion of gastroenteritis outbreaks arising from fecal contamination of pools are attributable to <em>Cryptosporidium</em> oocysts.</p> <p>In addition to contributing to advancement of scientific knowledge and technology development, the project supported the professional development of an early career investigator (the PI), three graduate students (two UW PhD students and one visiting PhD student), and ten undergraduate students (six from the UW, and four from outside universities). The project also provided a total of twenty-five Seattle-area high school teachers (Figure 5) with the opportunity to participate in hands-on experimental work through a summer workshop program focusing on inquiry-based curriculum development in collaboration with the project team (for an overview, see: <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/doddm/Personal/WaterWorks.html">http://faculty.washington.edu/doddm/Personal/WaterWorks.html</a>).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Michael&nbsp;Dodd</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1236303/1236303_10194827_1511928811902_Projectoutcomes-Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1236303/1236303_10194827_1511928811902_Projectoutcomes-Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1236303/1236303_10194827_1511928811902_Projectoutcomes-Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Enhancement of Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst and Bacillus subtilis spore inactivation rates during exposure of free available chlorine (FAC) to solar irradiation (note that solar irradiation of FAC leads to generation of reactive oxygen species -
