<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1216789&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences&lt;br/&gt;PI:   N. Bates&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  R. Harelstad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) item for the R/V ATLANTIC EXPLORER operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS); namely a new main aft deck crane.  This award represents Year 1 of a multi-year project.  This item will improve safety and greatly enhance the vessel?s science support capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The R/V ATLANTIC EXPLORER supports federally funded scientific research throughout the Atlantic basin to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  The vessel also conducts the routine servicing of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) moorings.  During operations, graduate and undergraduate students are routinely exposed to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events.  The ATLANTIC EXPLORER is scheduled to complete 170 NSF sponsored days in 2012.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With $875,000 in funding from the National Science Foundation through a Shipboard Scientific  Support Equipment award in 2012, a new crane was installed aboard the  R/V Atlantic Explorer, marking the completion of a three-year collaborative effort between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and BIOS.  BIOS was tasked to develop a design, specification, and purchasing process  that could be used for future NSF purchases of deck equipment for  science missions on vessels in the University-National Oceanographic  Laboratory System (UNOLS) research vessel fleet.  Research vessels are one of ocean scienceÆs most valuable workhorses, providing researchers with access to remote waters and safely carrying scientific equipment and personnel around the world. Modern vessels must also be capable of simultaneously supporting research in a variety of disciplines (e.g., oceanography, geology, engineering, and even atmospheric science). As a result, research vessels are outfitted for both general operations and discipline-specific tasks.  One vital piece of deck equipment on any research vessel is the crane. Cranes are normally used for lifting only.  This crane will be used for  deploying and recovering science equipment.  As part of the design  process, every conceivable way this crane might be used to deploy  science equipment was identified, and then engineered to determine the  safe operating conditions and loads for each configuration.  Most of  these science mission scenarios involve side loading the crane, for  which cranes are not normally designed or built.  These side loads also  affect the vesselÆs stability at sea, so it was critical to know the  safe limits of these loads in normal operational sea states.  Every loading condition for this crane, whether cargo or science, is  explained in a Maximum Capability Document (MCD) which provides easy to  reference and understand information for rigging and load limits under  all operational conditions.  In constructing this crane, our goal was to meet or exceed every  applicable and appropriate safety and engineering standard.  Both  American Petroleum Institute (API) and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)  standards were used in addition to the UNOLS RVSS requirements.  The new crane, an extendable knuckle boom design, offers several improvements over the former crane: improved safety for cargo and equipment loading, better design and construction allowing for use of the crane during science overboard deployments, greater lifting capacity and reach, and remote wireless operation.  The crane sits atop a pedestal on the starboard side of the main deck, giving maximum accessibility to all of the aft and rear of the 01 decks. The crane is equipped with a load monitoring system which gives the operator a continuous read out of weight of load, length of boom out and distance (radius) from pedestal at both the crane operating station and on a wireless control box, which allows the crane operator to stand anywhere and have full control of the crane.  The load monitoring system provides safe load data for three different types of operation: cargo handling alongside the dock; science equipment moves or overboard operations at sea; and personnel lifts in any condition.  The end of the boom is connected with a bolted flange that can be used for attaching any docking head (e.g. used for Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) work or other science equipment needs).  All cranes, A-frames and Over-boarding Systems on new UNOLS/NSF vessels are being fitted with these standard flanged connections to facilitate shared use of equipment.  Glosten Associates, a naval architecture and marine engineering company in Seattle, Washington, was employed for the preliminary engineering required to develop a construction specification for the new crane. Appleton Marine, Inc., which recently built the cranes for the University of AlaskaÆs R/V Sikuliaq, was chosen to manufacture the crane due to their willingness to take on...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
