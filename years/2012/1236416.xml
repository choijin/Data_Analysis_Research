<AbstractNarration>1236416&lt;br/&gt;Kumar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many communication and military electronics require field - effect transistors which can operate in the frequency range of 100s of GHz to THz. Graphene is one of the thinnest and strongest known materials with exceptional electronic and thermal properties. The graphene based transistors can exceed the performance of existing transistors which makes them very attractive alternative for next generation high frequency devices. Graphene typically interacts with metals and insulators in its devices which significantly changes its properties. The performance of graphene based devices can be limited by the characteristics of the contact at the metal-graphene interface. It has become imperative to understand the electronic and thermal interaction between graphene and the metals it interfaces in its devices. The thermal and electrical transport across the metal-graphene interfaces is strongly dependent on the structure and nature of the chemical bond at the interface. It is important to decipher the coupled electronic-thermal transport at metal-graphene interfaces as a function of interfacial configuration in order to accurately model the performance of graphene devices and engineer the interfaces when possible. The objective of this research is to develop and employ systematic modeling and experimental techniques that consider the bonding and structure at metal-graphene interfaces in order to investigate the interfacial electrical-thermal transport and elucidate the crucial components of interfacial electrical/thermal contact resistances at time and length scales relevant to nanoscale graphene transistors. A first-principles-based study will be performed to correlate the interfacial thermal characteristics to the nature of chemical bonding and interfacial structure. Metal-graphene interface structures will be fabricated, characterized and thermal/electrical resistances will be measured. This research will lead to development of a new understanding of transport that sets the framework for modeling the performance of next-generation graphene devices with unprecedented accuracy, especially high-frequency and high-power devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of interfacial transport at metal-graphene contact developed by this research will provide directions for efficient thermal management of graphene transistors which will allow them to operate in very high frequency regimes or operate the device at lower temperatures. Such achievement will significantly enhance the capabilities of graphene transistors and reduce a critical barrier for use of these devices in high frequency electronics applications while leading to a significant gain in the energy efficiency, performance, and operating life of future electronic systems. The project will lead to the development of educational materials in the area of Computational Modeling and Energy Transport for both graduate and undergraduate students. Small demonstrations and lectures prepared by this research will increase the awareness of K-12 students for energy related problems and also motivate them for college and graduate education.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this project is to study fundamental thermal interactions between graphene and metals/dielectrics to provide insights on coupled electronic and thermal transport in emerging graphene devices. The project has employed systematic modeling and experimental techniques that consider the bonding and structure of graphene interfaces from first principles to accomplish this goal.<strong> </strong>This program has (i) developed an atomistic framework based on the first principle Density Functional Theory, Atomistic Green&rsquo;s Function and Molecular Dynamics; and investigated the phonon transmission and thermal boundary conductance (TBC) at graphene-metal interfaces and impact of different lattice stacking configurations on the thermal transport across the vertically stacked h-BN/graphene/h-BN interfaces. (ii) measured the TBC at metal-graphene-metal interfaces using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) to investigate the effect of physisorption and chemisorption on thermal transport at metal-graphene-metal interfaces.</p> <p><strong>Outcomes (Intellectual Merit):</strong> This research has performed first principle DFT and atomistic Green&rsquo;s function (AGF) based simulations to investigate phonon transmission and TBC at metal/Single Layer Graphene (SLG)/metal and metal/Multi-layer Graphene (MLG)/metal interfaces. Three different materials has been considered: Cu and Au for the weak physisorption bonding and Ti for strong chemisorption bonding. These metals are selected as they are very important for nano-electronic devices and also extensively used in experimental studies to explore thermal interaction at metal-graphene interfaces. The analysis establishes that the interfacial chemistry strongly affect the phonon properties of graphene layer in contact with metal and phonon transport mechanism at metal/MLG interfaces is strongly influenced by the interfacial bonding strength. The analysis shows that the TBC across Ti/SLG/Ti interfaces is significantly larger than the TBC across Cu/SLG/Cu and Au/SLG/Au interfaces. However, the TBC across Ti/MLG/Ti is order of magnitude lower compared to TBC at Ti/SLG/Ti interface, while TBC at Cu/MLG/Cu and Au/MLG/Au interfaces are similar to that of Cu/SLG/Cu and Au/SLG/Au, respectively. This substantial decrease in TBC at Ti/MLG/Ti interface is a result of phonon mismatch between graphene layer bonded to Ti and non-bonded graphene layers.</p> <p>The impact of different lattice stacking configurations on the thermal transport across the vertically stacked h-BN/graphene/h-BN interfaces has been investigated. The h-BN/graphene/h-BN sandwiched systems exhibit distinct stacking-dependent features in the phonon transport, and TBC.

The in-plane acoustic modes of graphene is found to have the dominant contributions to the TBC for the interfaces with the carbon atom located directly on top of the boron atom (C-B matched) compared to the C-N matched interfaces where the carbon atom is located directly on top of the nitrogen atom, because of the low interfacial gap. The investigation suggests that C-B matched interfaces have stronger phonon-phonon coupling than the C-N matched interfaces, even though C-N atoms have more intense force interactions.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to estimate thickness of the native oxide layer of bottom Ti and Ni layers which suggests that conductance of these thin native oxide layers was much greater than the overall TBC but these layers prevented formation of chemisorbed interfaces between graphene and metal for Ti and Ni cases leading to significantly low TBC.</p> <p class="TAMainText"><strong>Outcomes (Broader Impact)</strong>: This research has led to four journal publications, five refereed conference paper publications and five additional technical presentations in international conference focused on material science or thermal transport.
