<AbstractNarration>This project will apply touch feedback technology (skin and stretch feedback) for use in a game controller and will result in a refined game controller with integral skin stretch feedback. Tactile interaction game effects that can be portrayed on this game controller will be integrated with a commercial video game to provide a demonstration of this technology. It is believed that this will lead to both improved game immersion and performance. Performance gains are expected to be in the form of faster completion times, improved spatial awareness and tracking capability, and reduced cognitive load of the user. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game controller with embedded skin stretch feedback has the potential to change the gaming world as well as to help this technology proliferate into other applications. The tactile effects portrayed in game play can be refined and applied to any number of applications that can benefit from an additional modality of communicated information. These applications include: mobile navigation in cars, airplanes, helicopters; military applications for improved control of mobile robots or unmanned aerial/marine/ground vehicles; and medical applications such as robotic surgery or rehabilitation; or providing guidance to the blind. Since the game controller also has great appeal to young adults, and to the public in general, it had been and will continue to be used for educational activities. The controller can serve as a platform to explain the importance of having a strong technical background in engineering and computer science, and shows that careers in engineering can be rewarding.</AbstractNarration>

This new means of emulating force feedback is the major intellectual merit of this research. It is of particular merit because this technology can portray force-like interactions that are more realistic than current vibration feedback (also known by the trade name "Rumble" feedback), yet does not require a robotic arm connected to a desktop as most force feedback devices require.

The broader impacts of this research is in creating a new form of touch (haptic) feedback that emulates force feedback, but in a low-cost, untethered package.
