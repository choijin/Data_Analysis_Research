<AbstractNarration>This action funds David Joseph Bodine of the University of Oklahoma to conduct a research project, entitled "Understanding the motion of debris and precipitation in tornadoes," during the summer of 2012 at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan.  The host scientist is Professor Takashi Maruyama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the use of a computer model to study how different debris and precipitation move in tornadoes, and how different types of tornado flows impact the concentration of debris and precipitation.  The results from the computer model help explain dual-polarimetric radar signatures of precipitation and debris in tornadoes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2012 East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute in Japan gave the PI the opportunity to conduct tornado simulations at Kyoto University under Professor Maruyama.  This project investigated the motion of debris and precipitation in tornadoes using a high-resolution numerical model called a large-eddy simulation (LES) model.  An understanding of debris motion in tornadoes is critical because airborne debris cause most tornado-related fatalities.  Thus, an improved understanding of debris motion in tornadoes can help mitigate these hazards through improved forecasting and engineering designs.  In 2011, tornadoes caused over 550 fatalities and $10 billion in damage, underscoring the importance of reducing tornado-related hazards.      The project involved several experiments with the LES model, simulating several types of common tornado flow structures.  In the single-cell vortex simulation, a strong updraft is present throughout the tornado with maximum vertical wind speeds in the center of the tornado.  In a two-cell vortex simulation, downward motion occurs in the center of the tornado and is surrounded by a region of upward motion.  In some cases, the tornado breaks down into multiple intense vortices that rotate around the central axis.  Using the LES model, these vortex flow types were simulated and the movement of debris and precipitation was calculated for small and large rain drops, leaves, rocks, small pieces of wood, and other debris types.     As part of the PIÆs Ph.D. Dissertation, several analyses of the LES experiments will be conducted.  Cursory comparisons of model simulations and radar observations suggest that some inferences may be made about flow structure based on radar signatures of tornadic debris.  Given the same debris type, differences in debris concentration are observed between the single-cell, two-cell, and suction vortex cases.  In the suction vortex simulation, the concentration of debris exhibits patterns similar to radar reflectivity patterns observed in previous radar cases with suction vortices.  The lofting location of large debris also has important implications for the altitude, travel time, and horizontal distance debris travel.  In the one- and two-cell vortex flow, debris lofted closest to center of the tornado reached the highest altitudes, travelled the largest horizontal distances, and remained airborne for the longest period of time.      The EAPSI experience provided a valuable opportunity to establish international collaborations, learn about similarities and differences in scientific methods and technology in Japan, and experience many aspects of Japanese culture.  The collaboration forged with Professor Maruyama through the EAPSI program will provide many new avenues for future research.  The EAPSI program provided several opportunities to learn about meteorological research in Japan, including visits to Tokyo University and the Meteorological Research Institute.  These visits and my experience at Kyoto University have given the PI a new international perspective on research methods and technology in meteorology and engineering, which will be valuable for the PIÆs career.  Finally, the PI learned much about Japanese culture by exploring the famous temples in Kyoto, staying with a host family, and experiencing traditional Japanese events such as sumo wrestling matches and different festivals.
