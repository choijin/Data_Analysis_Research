<AbstractNarration>The PIs propose to develop a statistical model for inferring past mean global sea level (GSL) and ice sheet volumes from geological indicators of changes in local sea levels. This model will employ a Bayesian statistical framework to combine geological observations and their uncertainties with a geophysical model of the spatial and temporal sea level patterns associated with different meltwater sources. The proposed work focuses on three specific applications: &lt;br/&gt;(1) evaluating the contribution of different ice sheets to high GSL during the Last Interglacial stage, ~130-115 thousand years ago; &lt;br/&gt;(2) assessing ice sheet history from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present, in particular estimating the net ice volume change across this time interval and assessing the relative contributions of the Laurentide and Antarctic ice sheets to meltwater pulse 1a at ~14.3 thousand years ago; and &lt;br/&gt;(3) over a broader sweep of the Quaternary and Pliocene, investigating the relationship between Northern and Southern hemisphere ice volumes and paleoclimate proxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geological record of past ice sheet responses to climate change can serve as a key data source for testing forward physical models of ice sheet dynamics under different climate scenarios. The model developed in this project will be an effort to synthesize such a data set, evaluate its associated uncertainties, and employ it to strengthen understanding of the relationship between key climate parameters (such as polar and circum-polar temperatures) and ice sheet stability.</AbstractNarration>

This grant produced a new database of geological sea-level records for the last ~3,000 years, as well as the first estimate of global sea-level (GSL) change over this time period to be based upon statistical synthesis of a global database of regional sea-level reconstructions. Global sea level varied by about &plusmn;8 cm (&plusmn;3") over the pre-Industrial Common Era, with a notable decline over 1000&ndash;1400 CE coinciding with &sim;0.2 &deg;C of global cooling. The 20th century global sea-level rise was extremely likely (95% probability) faster than global sea-level rise during any of the 27 previous centuries (Figure 2).

Statistical approaches developed under this grant informed the development of a global set of probabilistic, localized sea-level rise projections (Figure 4). The sea-level rise projections framework has been used to inform a number of sets of state and municipal projections around the country, as well as a national assessment of future coastal flood risk.  This grant also supported the development of several web-based tools and visuals to illustrate impacts that 20th century climate-driven sea-level rise, as quantified under this grant, has already had on U.S. coastal flooding (Figure 5); to illustrate 21st-entury localized sea-level projections coming out of the research; and to illustrate longer term sea-level rise commitments under different emissions and warming scenarios, as suggested by work under this grant and related research (Figure 6).
