<AbstractNarration>1236577&lt;br/&gt;Streator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is motivated by the quest to understand the tensile stresses exerted by liquids within small channels and to help mitigate the problem of "stiction" that is prevalent in micro and nano scale devices. Measurements of flow rate, tensile force, surface deformation and friction force will be performed for interfaces involving liquid interposed between solid bodies of prescribed surface roughness. In parallel with the experiments, a mathematical model will be developed that considers elastic deformation and capillary effects to describe the flow of a thin liquid film at the interface between contacting rough, elastic surfaces. This work will assess the validity of the notion of interface collapse as predicted by recently published mathematical models in the literature. This investigation will also serve to establish new lower bounds on the magnitude of negative capillary pressures generated in narrow interfaces. Results of the work are anticipated to have relevance to several technical areas, including those related to flow in porous media, the stability of wet soils, MEMS, magnetic recording, adhesives, and seals. Additionally, the project will provide enriched educational experiences for undergraduate and pre-college students. Undergraduate researchers will be involved in developing a video entitled "Capillary Connections" that features several physical demonstrations of capillarity, touching on several disparate areas, such as the stick-slip behavior of wiper blades, the ascent of water in plants, the function of adhesives, and mechanisms of absorption in porous bodies (like common sponges). It is planned to make the video publicly accessible by posting at YouTube. Leveraging the NSF-sponsored STEP program at Georgia Tech, undergraduate and graduate students supported by the proposed project will visit STEP partner high schools to show and discuss the Capillary Connections video.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  A theoretical and experimental study was performed to investigate the behavior of a liquid film at the interface of three-dimensional (3D) contacting rough surfaces.  Numerical models were created to analyze the development of adhesive forces contributed by the liquid film while accounting for the elastic deformation of the surfaces.  The first of these models was based on a spectral description of the surface topography, whereby each frequency level of the surface, obtained via a discrete Fourier Transform, is considered successively. Results of this model led to the identification of critical conditions for the onset of surface collapse, which is characterized by the sudden development of large adhesive forces.  The second of the models, representing higher fidelity at the expense of more computational cost, solves the contact problem by considering the normal stress and deformation at every nodal point.  Results of this model provided validation to the spectral approach, which required far less computational effort.  Experiments of adhesive strength were conducted between optical flats for several values of surface roughness, composite elastic modulus and interfacial liquid volume.  After a measured quantity of liquid was placed upon the lower surface, the upper surface, which was supported by a spring attached to a vertical stage, was lowered to form the contact.  The vertical stage was then raised, stretching the spring, until there was a sudden release of the contact.  The maximum external tensile force exerted upon the upper surface was recorded and defined as the pull-off force.  Predictions of pull-off force from the spectral model were found to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements.  Additionally, the theory demonstrated that the maximum adhesive force may significantly exceed the adhesive force at the pull-off point.   An apparatus was developed to assess the strength of liquid-mediated adhesion through its impact upon static friction. Lateral loads were gradually applied to the upper surface (via a spring coupled to a horizontal stage) until the onset of slip.  Results showed that, consistent with the theory, capillary forces from the film provide an additional normal load to the surface asperities.  A numerical simulation was developed that models the spreading of a liquid, driven by capillary effects, within the interface of contacting rough, elastic surfaces.  The simulation models a scenario where an annular body is placed in contact with a counter surface and a quantity of liquid is introduced in the hole of the annulus. The liquid film then spreads radially within the interface.  Tensile stresses within the film pull the surfaces into more intimate contact, which causes a reduction in the mean separation of the surfaces.  Based upon curve fitting the predictions from the numerical model, an analytical expression was developed that shows how the rate of liquid spread depends on the surface roughness, the composite elastic modulus, the external load, the liquid surface tension and the liquid viscosity.  In conjunction with the theory, direct optical measurements of capillary-driven spreading were performed with polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) liquids covering a broad range of viscosities. A novel image processing technique was implemented to compute the area of the wetted region at various time increments. Excellent agreement was found between theory and experiment. The image processing method, which enables accurate computation of surface area for an arbitrarily shaped continuous two-dimensional (2D) region, may be useful in the analysis of digital images from a variety of fields.  Broader Impacts  A video entitled "Capillary Connections" was developed by a female undergraduate student and then posted to YouTube.  The video, in which a narrator describes a sequence of graphical images, focuses upon the varied instances where capillary effects are important to natural processes as well as to man-made devices. Two undergraduate students, one female, and one African American male, were involved in visiting four area high schools, one area middle school and one pre-college summer enrichment program (located at Morehouse College, in Atlanta, Georgia) to present and discuss the video as well as answer questions about majoring in engineering-related fields.  The targeted classes and program were composed predominantly of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. More than 350 students were shown the video and all were surveyed to assess the impact of the video on their interest levels in mechanical engineering, in particular, and engineering sciences, in general.  Survey results showed that more than 75% of the students indicated an increased interest in each of these areas as a result of the presentation.
