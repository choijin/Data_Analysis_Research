<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for a workshop in Atlanta, GA, from November 18 to 2, 2011, with the goal of bringing together U.S. and Brazilian scientists to establish international research collaborations that will advance biodiversity science. The research projects that are likely to come from this workshop will enhance international collaboration and provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to have an international research experience.</AbstractNarration>

From 18&ndash;20 November 2011, we gathered leading biodiversity scientists from the USA and Brazil, to discuss steps for seeding and developing research ties among New World countries, and decide upon research priorities for potential collaborative and co-funded efforts for biodiversity research.The workshop provided a venue for discussing how to maximize interactions among researchers, identify ways in which to develop true intellectual partnerships in research and education, and provided an opportunity for team-building among two well-funded research communities in the New World: the United States and Brazil. It is evident from our interactions that Brazil&rsquo;s first-class and well-funded researchers are highly active and productive in interdisciplinary research, and are supportive of the establishment of collaborations with US researchers that enhance the integrative and comparative nature of biodiversity research.In addition to biodiversity researchers, representatives from the Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o de Amparo &agrave; Pesquisa do Estado de S&atilde;o Paulo (FAPESP) BIOTA Program and the National Science Foundation (NSF) also attended as participants at the workshop.
