<AbstractNarration>This study will identify the preparedness and response capabilities of the U.S. mass fatality management infrastructure, and in particular, the death care sector (i.e., the funeral industry and associated services).  Within the death care sector, this includes medical examiners/coroners, funeral directors, embalmers, funeral services and suppliers, cemeteries, cremation services, mortuary schools, certifying agencies and associations, etc. Their external response partners include: public health, healthcare, voluntary organizations, and local, state, and federal emergency response agencies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We know little about how this key sector will manage a very large number of deaths within our country. In other countries that were not well prepared, this led to civil unrest and poor recovery.  Mass fatalities may result from any number of events, such as terrorism, earthquakes, hurricanes, or other catastrophic disasters.  A widespread and large scale event, such as a highly lethal pandemic, might challenge the death care system in ways far greater than any other recent history event in the U.S., including the 2005 hurricanes and the September 11th World Trade Center terrorist attack. We will assess the preparedness of this sector using the Ready, Willing, and Able (RWA)  conceptual framework. Using a web-based survey platform, data will be collected from individuals representing a wide range of death care organizations, stratified by FEMA region. These data will be analyzed using two different strategies. First, univariate and multivariate techniques will assess RWA preparedness outcomes. Second, special  organizational network and simulation modeling analyses will be conducted using the data set.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will find any gaps in the ability of the key response groups in terms of their ability to manage a high number of fatalities  By identifying gaps, we can improve our preparedness for mass fatalities. This approach is less costly than large scale drills and exercises and can also be used by other key sectors in the U.S., including transportation, commerce, and health care.  The best possible response to such an event is through preparedness. Better management of mass fatalities can help the U.S. to maintain order and speed our recovery from a catastrophic event.</AbstractNarration>

In the United States, the management for mass fatalities is the responsibility of the Medical Examiner and Coroner system. Certain trends are increasing the risk of mass fatality incidents (MFI), defined as an event resulting in "more human bodies to be recovered and examined than can be handled by the usual local resources." Increasingly, there is also concern regarding disaster sites and remains that have been contaminated with hazardous chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosive (CBRNE) agents.
