<AbstractNarration>This is an observational study of a recently discovered old (~2 Gyr), nearby (~200 pc away) Open Cluster. This cluster?s close proximity means that main sequence stars could be studied to the brown dwarf limit and white dwarfs are also possible. The PI will complete analysis of data already in hand, and data from new observations at optical, ultraviolet and x-ray wavelengths in order to characterize the stellar membership in the cluster. He will also make use of archived data in the literature. Stellar distances will be measured using astrometric observations; activity will be measured from x-ray and optical emission-line spectroscopy and photometry; and cluster membership will be identified from proper motion studies using radial-velocity measurements.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include producing results that are useful to other fields of astronomy, the involvement of a graduate research assistant, and development of a laboratory exercise for introductory astronomy courses.</AbstractNarration>
