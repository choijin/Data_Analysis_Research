<AbstractNarration>This action funds Elaine Lee of the University of Pennsylvania to conduct a research project, entitled "Patterned polymeric materials for cell studies," during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea.  The host scientist is Dr. Kahp-Yang Suh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to understand cell behavior on man-made materials which can respond to the environment. Using novel fabrication techniques, micro- and nano-scale features can be patterned on soft, polymeric materials to mimic the natural environment of the cells. This project aims to understand how changing the physical properties of the materials will affect cell size, shape, function and behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

Over 2 months, my colleagues were able to overcome their initial shyness and we shared many meals as well ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
