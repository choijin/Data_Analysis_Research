<AbstractNarration>The Exploratorium, in collaboration with the Boys and Girls Club Columbia Park (BGC) in the Mission District of San Francisco, is implementing a two-year exploratory project designed to support informal education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) within underserved Latino communities.  Building off of and expanding on non-STEM-related efforts in a few major U.S. cities and Europe, the Exploratorium, BGC, and residents of the District will engage in a STEM exhibit and program co-development process that will physically convert metered parking spaces in front of the Club into transformative public places called "parklets."  The BGC parklet will feature interactive, bilingual science and technology exhibits, programs and events targeting audiences including youth ages 8 - 17 and intergenerational families and groups primarily in the Mission District and users of the BGC. Parklet exhibits and programs will focus on STEM content related to "Observing the Urban Environment," with a focus on community sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores one approach to working with and engaging the public in their everyday environment with relevant STEM learning experiences.  The development and evaluation processes are being positioned as a model for possible expansion throughout the city and to other cities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ciencia P&uacute;blica: Co-Creating Public Outdoor Learning Spaces with Latino Communities was a 3 year NSF-funded collaboration between the Exploratorium, the Boys and Girls Club of San Francisco (BGCSF), and the Buena Vista Horace Mann School (BVHM). The Parklet houses four exhibits focused on the themes of water and sustainable water use and are intended to engage Latino families in its location, the Mission District.  The main goal of this project was to co-develop STEM exhibits in public spaces focusing on observation and urban environmental sustainability within the Latino community.  Ciencia P&uacute;blica Parklet primary outcomes:  Intergenerational groups will actively engage with the Parklet exhibits; Visiting families will deepen their understandings about STEM content of the Parklet exhibits; Intergenerational groups will personally connect with the culturally relevant exhibits.   It was also expected that the collaboration with the BGCSF would deepen partnersÆ understandings about co-developing STEM exhibits in public spaces.   Below, is a summary of the summative evaluation key findings.  Community Response  All participants in this study saw value in the Parklet, particularly due to its subject matter. They believed the Parklet helped raise awareness about the drought in California and reminded the community of the importance of conserving water. Respondents found the ParkletÆs topic timely and critical. They appreciated the educational aspect of the Parklet, commenting that this focus set it apart from other parklets in the Mission (which they generally felt only benefited the businesses that sponsored them). Thus, they saw the Ciencia P&uacute;blica Parklet as being for the entire community.  Awareness/Understanding  There was strong evidence that families engaged with both the exhibits and the STEM content. While the drought was a familiar topic to all participants, the experiences at the Parklet provided opportunities for participants to explore ideas, reflect on the drought, and consider the importance of conserving water.  We documented positive family interactions and conversations at the Parklet. The four exhibits had their individual strengths and challenges, but overall, provided opportunities to engage with different, yet complimentary aspects of the topic. The Watering Plants interactive, for example, provided opportunities to explore water-efficient strategies for watering (and growing) plants. We observed significant intergenerational engagement, including conversations about how the component worked and ways participants might create their own systems at home to more efficiently conserve water. The strength of the Salt Water component was in helping visitors explore, how desalination&mdash;actually works. The Rain component, particularly the histogram depicting historic and current rainfall, generated significant conversation and comparison of rainfall levels, the severity of the drought, and the need to conserve water. The Water Vapor interactive was the least successful and most challenging conceptually.  Bilingual Labels  Bilingual labels were positively received and communicated that everyone in the community was welcome. Respondents noted that given the makeup of the MissionÆs residents, it was appropriate and important that the Parklet include information accessible to both Spanish and English readers. Both observations and interviews confirmed that the bilingual labels provided familiesÆ access to information and helped maintain a groupÆs linguistic practices and norms, two things critical both in designing culturally responsive experiences and in ensuring access to the exhibit content.  Diversity within the Latino Community  We found important differences in the ways that families with parents who have more formal education and those parents with less formal education engaged with the Parklet.  Families with caregivers having more formal education drew on the learning models they were soc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
