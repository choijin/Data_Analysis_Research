<AbstractNarration>The project will investigate inexpensive catalytic materials and new energy delivery mechanisms to efficiently transform waste plastics into valuable building-block chemicals and fuels.  Fundamental insights will be obtained to develop continuous and modular chemical transformation processes that will enable local municipalities to utilize waste plastics (as well as other types of municipal waste) for economic gain. The project focuses on technologies compatible with the scale of municipal waste treatment plants, thus avoiding long-distance transport of waste material for processing in large centralized chemical processing plants.  Beyond promoting U.S. competitiveness in cyclic and environmentally friendly chemical processes, the project will include education and outreach efforts to train next-generation scientists and engineers, while also increasing societal awareness of the plastics pollution problem and efforts to solve the issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary efforts in the investigator's laboratory have determined that uncatalyzed thermal radical reaction mechanisms dramatically limit the efficiency and role of catalytic materials in the catalytic conversion of polyolefins to higher-value medium and long-chain alkanes and alkenes. Additionally, the prior work has revealed linkages between the catalysis and heat and mass transport effects, thus inhibiting the development of fundamental mechanistic insights needed for catalyst and reaction environment design. The project will investigate the design and use of advanced reactor geometries specific for highly viscous polymer melt mixing to understand and limit the effect of mass transport in the catalytic cleavage of polyolefins. A new microwave energy delivery mechanism that delivers heat energy directly to the catalyst particles will be employed to avoid or dramatically reduce the role of uncatalyzed thermal radical reaction mechanisms.  The fundamental surface reaction energetics of a bifunctional catalyst that presents both acid and metallic reaction sites will be investigated such that constituent reaction kinetics for polyolefin dehydrogenation, C-C cleavage, and hydrogenation may be balanced and optimized. A mechanically and chemically-robust microwave susceptor, silicon carbide (SiC), will be used to simultaneously provide tunable solid acid reaction sites, quench thermal radicals, and convert microwave energy to localized heat energy. The SiC acid catalyst will be combined with well-defined non-noble metal intermetallic compound nanoparticle catalysts that will provide metal-like surface chemistry to achieve efficient hydrogenation. Additionally, the role of hot phonons, produced through microwave absorption by SiC, will be investigated for accelerating kinetically-difficult reaction steps. To derive clear connections between bulk and surface catalysis, the catalysts will be investigated using ex- and in-situ x-ray diffraction and high-resolution energy-dispersive x-ray, x-ray photoelectron, and high-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering spectroscopies. Utilizing a suite of reaction conditions that provide a range of heat and mass transport environments, clear insights into the role of uncatalyzed reaction mechanisms, intermediate chemical potential, and composition polarization near the catalyst surface will be developed. The role of chain dynamics and branch points in the catalytic cleavage mechanism will also be determined such that a more robust and general catalytic process may be developed to operate on practical mixed polyolefin waste. The role of water content in motivating optimal catalyst formulations will also be determined to ensure the application of the science developed to real-world polyolefin up-cycling efforts. Beyond polyolefin up-cycling, this project will produce transferable understanding associated with heat and mass transport and reactor design that may greatly improve efforts to catalytically up-cycle recalcitrant, solid, or highly viscous materials. The educational component will enhance the chemical engineering and materials science programs of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and raise awareness of the plastics pollution problem in the local community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
