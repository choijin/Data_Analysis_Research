<AbstractNarration>The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses numerous proteins to infect human cells, evade an immune response, and replicate itself. These proteins have moving parts that are essential to their function.  Understanding the way the proteins move and change conformation will provide novel insights into viral biology and could potentially reveal new therapeutic opportunities. Researchers supported by this award are simulating the SARS-COV-2 proteins using the Folding@home distributed computer, which pools the computational resources of volunteer citizen scientists across the globe to run simulations on their personal computers.  As a result of huge public interest and very productive interactions with major technology corporations, the Folding@home network now provides access to over 23 million CPU cores and 600,000 GPUs, making the network roughly 10-times more powerful than the world’s fastest traditional supercomputer. Support from this award will provide much needed upgrades to the cyberinfrastructure required to effectively harness this unprecedented computational resource and engage productively with the millions of people now participating in the effort to better understand SARS-COV-2.  Results of the research effort will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, and distributed broadly by social media and popular press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Folding@home is one of the largest and most successful distributed computing projects in the world.  Current research efforts on the SARS-COV-2 include a dynamic analysis of every viral protein and free energy perturbation modeling of more than 50,000 small molecule interactions to identify possible starting points for therapeutics.  Searching for cryptic binding sites is a major focus of the effort and early results are promising.  With support from this award, improvements in the Folding@home TCP/IP stack, work collection servers, and back-end analysis servers will be conducted to increase the utilization efficiency of distributed computing resources.  The additional capacity will also enable support for more projects with basic biological research relevance.  This RAPID award to Washington University in Saint Louis is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Folding@home empowers anyone with a computer and an internet connection to become a citizen scientist and contribute to biological research by volunteering to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computer(s). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific team put all of their other work on hold and the Folding@home community (both scientists and volunteers) turned their full attention to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is responsible for COVID-19 disease. People from across the globe seized the opportunity to join forces against the virus. Within three months of launching its first simulations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, Folding@home grew from 30K active devices to over 1M. The result was the world?s first exascale computer, capable of running a billion billion operations per a second. For perspective this performance is 5-fold greater than the world?s fastest supercomputer at the time. This extraordinary computational resource enabled Folding@home to simulate most of the proteins from SARS-CoV-2, producing about 100K times more data than a typical simulation paper in the first six months of the pandemic. These simulations revealed extensive dynamics that are now informing the development of new therapeutics. For example, simulations conducted on Folding@home predicted that the spike complex that decorates the surface of the virus opens far more dramatically than previously imagined. Differences between the probability of opening between different coronaviruses explain their differing abilities to infiltrate cells and evade an immune response. The structural data also reveals 'cryptic' sites that are actually accessible to therapeutics despite appearing to be inaccessible in previously known structures. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that antibodies do indeed bind to such surfaces. These results and more for other proteins from the virus were presented in preprint in June of 2020 that is now published in Nature Chemistry (Zimmerman <em>et al.</em> 2021). To accelerate progress by the entire scientific community, all the data generated by Folding@home are all freely available online through OSF (<a href="https://osf.io/fs2yv/">https://osf.io/fs2yv/</a>), the NSF-funded MolSSI center (covid.molssi.org/), &nbsp;and the AWS Public Datasets program (<a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/foldingathome-covid19/">https://registry.opendata.aws/foldingathome-covid19/</a>).
