<AbstractNarration>The annual ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS) is a top-tier venue for quick and wide dissemination of cutting-edge research results in computer and communications security. The conference achieves this by hosting several technical sessions, in-depth tutorials poster sessions, panels and workshops.  The conference also invites leading researchers every year for keynote talks. They present seminars on some of the most intriguing and pressing challenges in the discipline, highlighting open avenues for further work in these areas. The 2019 ACM CCS will consist of approximately 140 technical papers across a wide spectrum of computer and network security and privacy domains. Participation in the conference is a valuable opportunity to students and is an important part of graduate education in cyber-security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2019 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by statement of research, CV showing research output, coursework and/or project experience, etc. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
