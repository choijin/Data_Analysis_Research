<AbstractNarration>Today, classrooms are challenged by the need for flexible learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic and for dynamic course materials that attract students from diverse backgrounds and allow them to thrive. This EAGER initiates a pilot effort to develop research-based learning modules for the upper level geophysics classes that can be used by geophysics programs across the country. At the upper level there are fewer resources for teaching and course development guides, and there is a notable drop off in students from underrepresented groups. This EAGER will explore how to implement high quality teaching materials to create a more equitable and inclusive learning environment that can build student confidence and allow students from a variety of diverse backgrounds to succeed. The PI team brings together complementary academic expertise facilitating the creation of a broad range of teaching modules and the convergence between upper level geophysics students and students in core STEM disciplines such as physics, mathematics, and computational science, which are fundamental disciplines on which global seismology relies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will design multimodal pilot modules on (1) Elastodynamics, (2) Seismology and Plate Tectonics, and (3) Near surface seismological methods and applications to the developed environment. The work has the potential to transform the traditional teaching mechanisms for upper level geophysics courses, and be used as a means to attract underrepresented groups to geophysics who may not have otherwise considered Earth science as a research focus. The project will incorporate flipped course design and mastery learning to help build student confidence, with the  materials created in such a way that they are adaptable to both on-line and in-person teaching. In addition, the team will further develop inclusivity through the creation of biographies featuring scientists from underrepresented groups that will be incorporated directly into the learning modules. The pilot modules will specifically focus on upper level geophysics courses to address and support students transitioning from undergraduate training to graduate school or to professional work in the geosciences, thus extending the pedagogical support from lower level to upper level geophysics teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
