<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a prosthetic hand that offers a truly “lifelike” appearance to enable an active lifestyle, confident return-to-work capabilities, athletic pursuits, and optimal self-image.  Over half a million people in the US are affected by upper-limb loss and the majority choose either non-functional cosmetic prostheses or none. Though existing devices have evolved advanced technical capabilities, overall use has remained static due to problems with ease-of-use, weight, and size.  This project proposes a novel prosthetic hand for decreased disability, increased productivity, and improved confidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of technology in prosthetic hand control, production, and mechanical architecture.  Currently, multi-fingered hands require the user to command coded patterns of muscle contractions whenever he/she wants to change posture.  Users report this extra step and associated planning effort as onerous and disruptive to task performance.  The proposed technology is a novel method of electromyographic interface (EMG) hand control that offers a more intuitive way of accessing a larger grasp space while retaining the simplicity and robustness of standard two-site EMG.  Because prosthetic hands are attached to the body via soft tissue rather than directly to the bone, their weight is generally perceived as something that needs to be carried.  The proposed device utilizes a production approach that capitalizes on newly available cellular structure synthesis software and additive manufacturing to significantly increase structural efficiency and reduce mass at competitive cost.  Due to unnatural size, prosthetic hands typically draw unwanted attention even when covered with a glove.  To reduce size, the proposed device utilizes a unique actuation topology facilitated by a bottom-up design approach that leverages practical finger individuation differences to reduce motor count and mechanical complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our team, High Five Bionics (number 2028), participated in NSF I-Corps 2020 Fall cohort #1 to be held in San Francisco but converted to a virtual cohort due to a pandemic and concomitant travel restrictions. During the period from kickoff on September 21 to October 16, which constituted 52% of the total course duration, we learned a tremendous amount about how to best launch a technology startup company, primarily through participation in online classes, office hours consultations with faculty, recommended and required reading, viewing of all video materials that had been created for the course, and 54 customer discovery interviews.     Quantifiable results included large improvements in our approach to, and expertise in, performing customer discovery, reflected in improved rates of daily interview acquisition and extent of information acquired.  Our success rate at obtaining cold interviews was initially low, making us more reliant than intended on warm leads from our mentor, due to an overly formal approach that we were accustomed to in our scientific work but that was alienating to primary customers such as amputees, occupational therapists, and prosthetists.  By the third week, we had established a more direct and congenial approach that yielded high interview acquisition rates.  Notable material outcomes included a fully developed business model canvas that we had been able to receive approval of from several individual faculty during office hours, a refined presentation/pitch describing our value proposition and business case, and a detailed 3-year plan that included numbers on our market segment, competitor sales and revenues, revenue projections, and cost projections we could justifiably feel confident were comprehensive and accurate within reason.     With the amount we obtained during our limited participation in the course, we were disappointed to be terminated on October 16 for participating outside of the U.S.  In our case, guidance in that area may not have been as well defined as necessary for us to recognize we needed to travel to the U.S. in order to participate in a virtual cohort.  However, more than anything else, we are grateful to have had the opportunity to participate for the period that we were able to.  At the time of termination, we received recommendation to reapply and participate in another cohort.  However, primarily due to a combined inability for team members to arrange another 7 weeks of leave from work and concern that we apparently did not fulfill our responsibility to uphold eligibility requirements, we do not expect to make the necessary requests of NSF and Vanderbilt University to do so.
