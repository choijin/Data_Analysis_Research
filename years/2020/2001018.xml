<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a smart wearable monitor capable of delivering clinical-grade measurements of lung function (e.g., tidal volume, forced expiratory volume, minute ventilation, etc.).  However, while suitable for in-hospital care, the current solutions present drawbacks in the delivery of telecare and self-management. The value proposition of this project is to present a non-invasive continuous pulmonary function monitor for persons with an acute or chronic respiratory illness to self-manage, monitor, or prevent exacerbations of their illness. This monitor would be implemented as a stretchable, wearable sensor that estimates changes in the size of the ribcage from breathing.  The development of such a technology has significant potential for reducing fatal opioid overdoses, asthma- and COPD-related emergency department visits, and support pulmonary rehabilitation delivered via telemedicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential for a wireless single-band stretchable silicone sensor, which when worn around the chest is capable of measuring tidal volume from which other measures of lung function can be derived (e.g., forced expiratory volume, minute ventilation, etc.). Currently, lung function testing, spirometry, capnometry, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and pulse oximetry are the clinical standard for vital monitoring and assessing lung function. Until now, respiratory inductance plethysmography monitors, which requires two bands – a chest-worn and abdomen worn band, is the least invasive technology for tidal volume monitoring. Pulse oximetry is an inferior technology for the early detection of respiratory distress (or colloquially, shortness of breath) because changes in oxygenation take time. In contrast, for example, respiratory depression can be quickly detected by changes in tidal volume. However, capnography and respiratory inductance plethysmography monitors, which are capable of monitoring tidal volume, are cumbersome and ill-suited for use outside a clinical setting.New evidence has now demonstrated that by measuring the change in circumference of the ribcage, you can estimate tidal volume with high fidelity using a stretchable sensor capable of confirming to the body. Integrating this sensor technology into a wearable device with a wireless sensor module has the potential to unlock new avenues for telehealth monitoring and delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this I-Corps project entitled "A Mobile-Based Opioid Overdose Alerting System" was to explore the commercial potential for a wireless single-band stretchable silicone sensor and software application, which when used is capable of measuring various respiratory parameters wirelessly. Currently, lung function testing, spirometry, capnometry, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and pulse oximetry are the clinical standards for respiratory monitoring and assessing lung function.  The primary area of focus for this project was exploring the market and refining the business model for the device’s ability to monitor and warn individuals suffering from an opioid overdose.   This I-Corps program allowed a refinement of the customer segment and a thorough understanding of the various commercialization options for this medical device.  Iterative refinement of the business model was achieved through participation in this program and customer segment interviews that ultimately lead to a greater understanding of the barriers and opportunities for bringing this product to market.     This technology and its application have numerous potential applications in addition to monitoring for respiratory depression as evidence of opioid overdose.  Monitoring and tracking respiratory performance across a number of other conditions such as asthma, COPD, sleep apnea, and other lung conditions is the subject of ongoing business model exploration.
