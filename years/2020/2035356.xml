<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The absence of prototyping infrastructure for research into microelectronic devices based on silicon carbide (SiC) limits US research and product discovery. The absence of such infrastructure forces activity abroad, if it occurs at all, and slows progress on innovation of electronic systems. The vision is of a unique SiC research facility that will spark innovation from growth and processing of materials, to device and circuit fabrication. This infrastructure would address a key gap in the nation’s research capabilities. The conference will benefit academic researchers and students as well as collaborators from industry and national laboratories. This will be a virtual conference and so online attendance will magnify its impact. The conference will identify potential impacts and spur the design and implementation of an open access SiC fabrication facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop is to identify the critical needs and user support for an openly-accessible silicon carbide (SiC) fabrication facility that can enhance the US research access to low-volume prototyping of the next generation of power electronics. The conference will: (i) Organize leading SiC researchers and key players to evaluate the current state and infrastructure needs of research community; (ii) Include individuals with experience in the management of mid-scale infrastructure for mentoring; (iii) Provide a platform for researchers to meet and engage in objective and constructive dialog about future directions for SiC research in materials, devices, and circuits and clearly define the needed infrastructure; (iv) Allow researchers to exchange ideas on research areas that can be addressed by the national SiC fabrication facility that surrounds the power semiconductor driven ecosystem.; (v) Assess broader impacts that this mid-scale research infrastructure can provide. The conference will identify national needs for such research infrastructure, and provide plans to close the identified gap in national needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Several important outcomes from the Online Workshop on Mid-Scale Research Infrastructure addressed the needs and associated barriers for progress in developing competitive silicon carbide (SiC) technology in the US. Attendees identified the problem that researchers who want to explore new ideas in SiC research in the US  may currently only do so by traveling to Europe to use facilities available there. No such facility is currently available to US SiC academic and industry researchers.  The attendees identified a SiC research and fabrication facility as critical and of high priority for US researchers to advance US research capabilities and knowledge in SiC fabrication.

Consequently, the US's lack of such a facility places the country at a disadvantage, causing the US to lag behind countries in Europe and Asia. Moreover, because of the diversity of sectors affected by advances in SiC research, the potential for research to advance knowledge within and outside its field is high and will enable groundbreaking innovations across a broad range of fields or disciplines and will revolutionize growing markets.  The facility should be open and provide easy access to all researchers in the SiC field. Consequently, the Fab has the potential to benefit universities and small businesses across the US as the facility will offer a platform to advance science and engineering education. In this way, SiC will enable groundbreaking innovations across a broad range of fields or disciplines and revolutionize growing markets, including: (1) transition from the internal combustion engine to all-electric vehicles, (2) modernization of the electric power grid through advanced solar inverters and protection equipment, (3) powering data centers to provide greater reliability and efficiency, all of which will significantly impact the technology of the future and (4) enable key innovations in research in extreme environments, healthcare, UV interfacing, and sensing that would otherwise not be possible.  A third outcome is that the Fab should be designed to include careful plans to provide training of next generation of researchers and engineers and to develop a workforce that will meet the industry needs and promote economic development. This should include the necessary facilities for the training of both the researchers and younger staff who can then spread out to other places. This hands-on training is currently not available in the US.  Two unexpected outcomes from the workshop were: (1) that we established the potential for vibrant research collaborations in the US that will utilize and grow around the proposed common need for a SiC Research Fab, and (2) the importance of the UA’s electronic packaging, process design kit (PDK) development and device SPICE modeling experiences sparked interest in a logical "one-stop shopping" for integrated circuit design, simulation, fabrication and backend packaging of devices and circuits.  The proposed SiC Research Fab is focused to develop a nationally decentralized solution to the instrumentation and knowledge-gap bottlenecks that are impeding progress and ingenuity in researching SiC material and inventing new devices. The decentralization refers to the US research community contributing advances that become incorporated into standard process flows in the SiC Research Fab. In fact, there seemed to be key interest in a research community advisory group that would assess and recommend such improvements over time, thus making the entire research community a stakeholder in the success of the Fab. The Research Fab's key goal is to make possible what is impossible today and even accelerate the prototyping of new ideas and transition them from laboratory demonstrations to industrial technologies by integrating material production and device fabrication with sophisticated but relevant characterization instrumentation. Through the convergent development of raw material and characterization, front-end SiC wafer designs and fabrication of integrated circuits, backend packaging, and testing, the "Open Access SiC Research Fab" will enable the discovery of new techniques, theory, and expertise within a united community of industrial and academic SiC researchers. For the first time, it will provide a digital platform that will catalyze collaborations and serve as a central clearinghouse for all things SiC.

The Fab will strive to continually recruit new users and spawn new collaborations through community engagement. In this way, the Research Fab will leverage national research strengths collectively and advance SiC science and technology, maintaining US leadership and semiconductor fabrication in the US.  Our peers' collective wisdom answered that the SiC Research Fab would be a "game-changer".          Last Modified: 04/06/2021       Submitted by: Homer A Mantooth]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
