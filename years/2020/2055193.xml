<AbstractNarration>The spread of COVID-19 is forcing physical academic conferences to suddenly move online. Since conferences are critical to the fabric of many scientific and engineering communities, making their online versions as good as they can be -- especially, doing everything we can to replace the unstructured, serendipitous conversations and connections that are the lifeblood of conferences -- is of the utmost importance. But the virtual conferences that have happened so far have not been very successful at replicating this "hallway discussions." The goal of this project is to rapidly develop a Web-based virtual conference platform, dubbed Clowdr, that will support several modalities for synchronous interaction among participants while alleviating the integration problems reported by participants at recent events. In the longer term, Clowdr-based online meetings will become an integral part of the conference ecosystem, supporting efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of scientific research coordination and improve diversity, accessibility, and fairness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The immediate focus for the project is the integration of all the necessary technological pieces for a successful conference in a single, easy-to-use web interface. A first version of this platform will be ready by the end of June 2020, and it will be continually improved until the end of the year based on participant and organizer feedback from a series of conferences. The platform will include areas for watching live talks along with chat and question-and-answer components, an area for watching past live talks with audience awareness, a poster and demo space where participants can join and easily switch, a lobby area where participants can start ad-hoc text and video chats, and other features.  The platform will be used later as the basis for research on human-social interactions in conference settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The spread of COVID-19 forced massive numbers of conference cancellations and left organizers scrambling for alternative ways of disseminating the work that was to be presented at their conferences. The disruption started in early March, will last at least until the end of 2021, and possibly significantly longer. Conferences are critical to the fabric of scientific and engineering communities. The easiest way to replace physical conferences is to forego synchronous meetings and focus only on their asynchronous ?outputs.? But this model eliminates precisely what makes a conference a conference: the real-time social interaction among participants. Making online conferences more synchronous, however, has been a challenge.    Our goals in this project had two times scales: (1) within a very short period of time (3 months) we wanted to develop a Web-based virtual conference platform, dubbed Clowdr, that supported several forms of synchronous and asynchronous interaction among participants while alleviating integration problems; we then wanted to use Clowdr for holding several research conferences in 2020 and 2021; and (2) on a longer term, beyond the scope of this RAPID project, we want the Clowdr virtual conference platform to be of service to academic communities as they try to find their way towards more sustainable, inclusive, and accessible conferences.     This award enabled and funded the development of the Clowdr software, as well as its use by 9 international academic conferences in Summer and Fall 2020. Clowdr supports virtual interaction with a feeling of "presence" --- helping meeting attendees to feel like they are part of a community, and not simply viewers of a webinar. We continue to share our best practices and lessons learned for designing and hosting interactive online conferences on our website, and to make our platform available to the community as 100% open source. Its development is now managed and supported by a UK ?Community Interest Corporation,? Clowdr CIC, which aims to ensure the long-term sustainability of this project.
