<AbstractNarration>This project investigates the dynamic processes through which diverse social groups (individuals, organizations, and organizational networks) come to understand the causes and consequences of land loss and come to define the range of options available for reducing its impacts. Additionally, this research investigates how culture affects the transformational potential of risk reduction actions.  The setting for the research is a region with diverse communities and large and changing industries that is also suffering land loss that affects these communities and industries.  This project analyzes efforts by a variety of organizations, groups, and individuals to counteract and cope with the land loss. Data for the project are being collected through ethnographic observation, interviews, and documents.  Findings will increase understanding of collective decision-making on a large scale and on issues that have broad effects on public well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will seek to identify the conditions affecting the acceptance or rejection of particular risk framings and strategies and to explore how these dynamics relate to broader institutional forces that affect risk reduction. Data for this project are collected from legal, scientific, and media documents, key informant interviews, interviews of organizational actors involved in land loss risk reduction, and ethnographic observation of public and restorative events.  Analysis of the data is through coding to ascertain patterns in use of cultural narratives by actors along with contextual details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research award supported the project entitled "Institutional and Cultural Effects on Organized Risk Reduction Efforts." This project was a key part of the co-PI’s doctoral dissertation research. The goal of this project was to understand why climate change and coastal land loss risk reduction efforts undertaken in Louisiana may actually exacerbate risks for frontline communities.  Frontline communities are the most physically exposed to the negative effects of climate change and are also highly dependent upon coastal resources for their survival. In Louisiana, frontline communities are racially and ethnicially diverse (inlcuding Native American, Black, Southeast Asian, Hispanic, and Cajun) and are working-class. Past scholarship has explained Louisiana’s response with reference to political-economic factors, such as the financial constraints imposed upon Louisiana’s coastal program and the lack of political will to regulate harmful development activities. This project is novel in that it sought to home in on cultural and institutional factors shaping risk reduction efforts, factors which have not been the focus of past scholarship on Louisiana's coastal program. This project also used multiple sources of data to illustrate the adaptation challenges facing frontline communities.   Funds from the award were used to support data analysis and writing. Funds were used to have in-depth interviews transcribed and were also used to purchase ArcGIS Pro and complete trainings on spatial analysis and mapping. Given these resources, the co-PI was able to finish her analysis, meet project goals, and complete her doctoral dissertation.  The dissertation has several key findings. First, the co-PI found that cultural values and institutional norms in Louisiana support the idea that the coast is a "working coast." This means that industry (particularly the oil and gas industry) is a fundamental part of the coastal environment and is part of the reason why the coast should be restored. The co-PI also found that frontline community members had legitimate concerns about how large-scale engineered structures (called sediment diversions) will exacerbate their flood risk and alter fish and wildlife habitats they are dependent upon. The co-PI found that these claims were dismissed by institutional actors (government administrators, scientists, engineers, restoration non-profit employees) in Louisiana.

The co-PI highlights how cultural narratives used by institutional actors frame these types of projects as the only possible solution to land loss, although there are several other policy solutions that have been proposed by experts. The co-PI also highlights how cultural narratives frame frontline communities as outside of a "bigger picture" of what it means to save the coast.
