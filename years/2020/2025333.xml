<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is technology that encompasses the development of customizable carbon fiber products and package formats at a low cost. Lack of suitable raw materials and corresponding processes has largely stymied the development and manufacturing of many high-volume industrial composite applications. The current advanced material reinforcement knowledge base is built on technology developed to serve space/aerospace composite material applications, which are relatively low-volume and cost-insensitive markets. This project focuses on creating a new platform designed specifically for high-volume, cost-sensitive industrial composite applications. The resulting carbon fiber products from this advanced material delivery platform can be tailored to facilitate a broad range of industrial composite applications currently unmet or underserved, such as automotive, wind energy and infrastructure applications.  This will potentially enable sizable performance and efficiency gains in those industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a new carbon fiber format technology platform. The proposed technology platform entails delivering carbon fiber with customizable tow linear densities produced from a universal conversion feedstock while seeking to maintain requisite and optimal physical properties of the carbon fiber. Physical properties of multi-level samples will be analyzed iteratively to determine acceptable linear density boundaries. Prototype mechanical devices will be developed to explore multiple viable approaches to optimize processes for the target product formats. The project also will determine the material handling viability of the resulting products for downstream composite uses. The project will explore the trade space of carbon fiber production economics, application requirements, and product performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Title: SBIR Phase I: Tailored Carbon Fiber Technology for High Volume Industrial Applications  PI: Connie Jackson  Awardee: CROSSLINK COMPOSITES, INC.   Award Number: 2025333  Award Ends:05/31/2021  Program Officer Name: Steven Konsek   Program Officer Email Address: skonsek@nsf.gov  Program Officer Phone Number: (703)292-7021     This Phase I project answered critical technical questions to help understand if CrossLink Composites, Inc. had a technically viable value proposition for its newly designed low-cost carbon fiber technology. The technical data generated in the Phase I experiments informed that the technology developed by CrossLink could generate acceptable quality, tailored linear density carbon fiber products from a uniform raw material feedstock.  Equally important were the commercialization lessons learned from the Phase I Boot Camp and I-Corps.  CrossLink's participation in Phase I Boot Camp provided excellent insight into how to best position a startup for a successful commercial launch for a technical product.  The guidance to first investigate whether the product or technology offers a value proposition for customers was invaluable.  CrossLink learned through customer interviews that our technology has a broad market opportunity if technical requirements of the customers are met.  But the team also learned that it needs to initially focus on a beachhead customer segment rather than plan for multiple customer segments for initial commercial launch. CrossLink needed to explore the pitfalls of the hypotheses regarding our expectations of what the team thought customers needed versus what they might actually need.  We learned great technology can struggle or even fail commercially if the channels to revenue within that market segment are not completely understood and exploited.  The extensive market research provided by DAWNBREAKER was incredibly helpful for our development of the Commercialization Plan.  This is a very impressive report compiled from a number of sources that we would not have had the resources to access.   CrossLink's participation in I-Corps provided equally important business and customer development guidance. Most importantly, we learned the importance of really listening to potential customers and to understand that they say things sometimes just to be polite, but there are usually still significant challenges between a technology or product and customer money.  We learned a company really has to do their homework to successfully capture a customer, especially with a new product.  That said, the CrossLink team identified a beachhead customer segment that fits well with our business model canvas and has successfully gained customer participation with our product development.   The I-Corps customer interviews were invaluable to informing the project to the regard of shortcomings in the current carbon fiber supply chain for high performance carbon fiber in volumes substantial enough to support their applications.  As a result, CrossLink tailored its focus on designing a manufacturing system to produce high volumes of high-performance, low-cost carbon fiber that can meet the emerging industrial demand.
