<AbstractNarration>The COVID-19 outbreak is affecting the national food system. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. stay-at-home measures) have disrupted food production, distribution through supply chains, and household food security. This project will collect ephemeral data on several components of the US food system that may not otherwise be properly archived during the pandemic. It will analyze the impacts of the disruptions on food production, food consumption, and supply chains to identify those locations most vulnerable to food security impacts. This project will also develop innovative analytical models and data integration approaches to investigate how the US food system is affected during a pandemic. Research outcomes, including county-level maps, model code, and spatial datasets, will be made freely available online for the research community. An online, interactive tool to explore how COVID-19 has disrupted the food supply chain will be produced to engage the public, media, and policy makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COVID-19 is creating dramatic changes in the location and timing of food supply and demand through impacts on large institutional buyers, grocery stores and food pantries. These sudden shocks to supply and demand by location are already giving rise to localized price volatility in some areas. Households that have experienced a loss of income due to labor disruptions are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of these food price shocks. This research seeks to understand the geographical dimensions of food security, such as where and how COVID-19 is impacting the food system, with a focus on increasing food system resilience. Novel data will be gathered and methods developed to determine the impact of COVID-19 on US food production, distribution, and demand. The model and research approach developed in this project will be generalizable to evaluating other disruptions to national supply chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research project was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on food supply and food security in the United States. Analysis was designed within three core elements: 1) impacts on agri-food production, 2) patterns of household food consumption and security and 3) resilience of food supply chain.   During the COVID-19 pandemic 47% of the total population has experienced or expected loss of employment income during the covid crisis, while this number is larger in all regions for Black and Hispanic respondents.  In terms of food security, while relatively high for all respondents (7.9-11.1%), it was markedly higher Black or Hispanic respondents (13.92- 20.26%). A larger proportion of the population in the South (11.07%) than the other regions (Total US : 9.88%, Midwest : 8.37%, Northeast : 7.90%, West : 8.75%) experienced food insufficiency during the COVID crisis.   Food security is connected to household income trends and during the COVID-19 pandemic income loss was higher for women, Black and Hispanic populations. Income losses were higher in states and times when covid cases are particularly high. Incomes for Black identifying househods were particularly negatively impacted in locations with high covid case rates.  Black and Hispanic identifying households were more likely to experience food shortages during the pandemic. Food insecurity becomes severe as more people experience income declines from employment. Food insecurity was associated with a 2.7% increase in mortality rate. Meat flows decreased in most places across the country and were concentrated in outflows from major meat producing states. In summary, food insecurity was associated with covid and covid-induced income losses, and in turn, is correlated with higher mortality rates.  32% of Arizona households experienced food insecurity since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic - this contrasts pre-pandemic level of food insecurity of 25%. Hispanic households, households with children and households that experienced job disruption were mote likely to be both persistently and newly food insecure. A majority of respondents were worried that food prices would increase and early in the pandemic (July 2020) households were concerned about the availability of food and support from food assistance programs. Analysis by colleagues in the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University found that food assistance programs (SNAP) were considered inadequate to meet family needs by more than half of households. 39% of households experienced some form of job disruption since the onset of the pandemic.  This project created research development experiences for 2 PhD students, 2 Masters students and 6 undergraduate students.
