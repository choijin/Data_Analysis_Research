<AbstractNarration>Smart inverters interfacing solar panels, energy storage units, and electric vehicles to the main electric grid are an effective grid control mechanism to cope with the voltage fluctuations induced by solar generation in residential grids. However, selecting the power injections for hundreds of inverters in real time is a formidable task. To hit the sweet spot between cyber demanding optimization solutions and subpar local control, the proposed research develops novel algorithmic schemes for coordinating inverters based on control rules or policies trained through machine learning (ML). This program advances understanding of communication-limited decentralized control of residential electric grids and discovers novel uses of smart meter data, with immediate applicability to distribution systems and relevance to electric power utility practice. The expected benefits to industry are cutting-edge physics-aware ML solutions, advanced asset management, and value added for inverters, sensors, and grid communications. Enhancing grid controllability benefits society by enabling reliable integration of smart grid technologies, such as distributed solar generation, electric vehicles, and demand-response programs. Handling voltage excursions by inverters extends the lifetime of voltage regulators and capacitors, and postpones costly grid upgrades. The proposed research activities are integrated with educational and outreach objectives. The program reaches pre-college female students through hands-on learning activities on renewable energy sources and continues the PIs' outreach to undergraduate students through visits to residential communities and seminars. The findings will be integrated into the curricula of (under)-graduate courses on distribution grids and ML for energy systems, thus educating the upcoming power-engineering workforce on timely ML tools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aspires to integrate machine learning (ML) models into optimal power flow (OPF) formulations to develop data-adaptive and communication-limited smart inverter control schemes in power distribution grids. This is achieved by accomplishing the ensuing tasks: i) devise algorithmic solutions to ensure ML modules comply with inverter specifications and feeder constraints; ii) capture the physical coupling across ML modules through approximate and exact AC power flow equations under both model-based and model-free setups; iii) put forth stochastic and chance-constrained ML-based OPF schemes to deal with the uncertainty of solar generation and loads; iv) design learning architectures that are centrally trained and implemented in a distributed manner on a tight communication budget to exploit big historical data but small real-time data feeds; and v) ensure dynamic stability and safety when ML modules are driven by states to close the loop. The outcome will be a comprehensive suite of ML-based inverter optimization solutions validated using real-world data on benchmark feeders. The proposed research pioneers the design of data-driven nonlinear inverter control policies at the nexus of power systems, ML, robust control, and stochastic optimization. The original and potentially transformative idea of learning inverter control rules through a stochastic constrained OPF is the permeating theme of this project. When OPF and local control schemes fail to adjust to time-varying grid conditions, the proposed ML-OPF solutions exploit creatively designed neural network topologies, as well as advances in kernel-based and reinforcement learning to operate effectively under the train-big/operate-small data paradigm. Building communication-aware inverter control policies will advance our knowledge on constrained learning over a physical or engineered system under a tight communication budget. Research tasks explore different ML tools; account for model-based and model-free setups; handle approximate and exact grid models; and consider varying communication capacities between the utility and inverters. Uniquely combining expertise on distribution grids, statistical learning, robust control, and reinforcement learning, this project goes beyond communication-limited inverter control to bandwidth-limited resource allocation problems and cyber-physical systems control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
