<AbstractNarration>This project will study the population density in Newark, NJ, with a specific focus on the relationship between regulations and zoning, and the amount of housing in neighborhoods that are well-served by transit. Newark, NJ is a medium-sized city located in the New York metropolitan area, only 25 minutes from the center of Manhattan. It is a low-income city with many residents who struggle to access transportation, jobs, and affordable housing. As housing in the New York area has become increasingly scarce, residents in Newark are increasingly concerned that this new development will lead to their displacement. The city is now engaged in a highly consultative revision of its 10-year master-plan, which offers an opportunity to address issues, including regulatory and zoning limitations that prevent densification and make new housing unaffordable. This project aims to support that process by empowering residents and policymakers with data and a new decision-making tool that will help identify participatory and effective approaches to increase the supply of housing and improve housing affordability through the master plan revision process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A newly developed methodology for the measurement of ‘factors’ of population density will be used to create a decision-making tool and generate associated data; these factors include building height, plot coverage, the share of land in residential use, the occupancy rate, living area density, and floor-plan efficiency. The key advantage of measuring these factors from a policy perspective is that zoning and building regulations determine the maximum values for many of them. Earlier work approached density as a horizontal measure, a strategy which furnished useful information but was disconnected from policy. The factoring approach has clear policy implications for increasing the supply of housing. The quantification of these factors uses satellite imagery to measure residential buildings, field information to measure the occupancy rate, and a regulatory audit to associate each of the factors with actual policies, enabling a truly detailed set of policy recommendations to emerge. The goal of this research is to model the factors of density and their relationship to regulations, providing data on the ways in which different regulatory changes might impact the supply of residential floor-space. This project is in response to the Civic Innovation Challenge program, Track A— Communities and Mobility: Offering Better Mobility Options to Solve the Spatial Mismatch Between Housing Affordability and Jobs—and is a collaboration between NSF and the Department of Energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Newark, NJ is a growing city that is seeing more new market-rate residential construction than it has in over 5 decades. As Newark prepares for its 10-year master plan revision, which will determine what land uses are permitted in the city?s 20 neighborhoods, it has a unique opportunity to reshape the urban fabric and create a city that works for all Newarkers.  This pilot program from NYU, the City of Newark and Bloomberg Philanthropies seeks to develop a new methodology for engaging community in the master planning process, to support the identification of acceptable strategies and approaches to increase the supply of housing, and to foster community empowerment around the development process ? critical prerequisites to any ambitious strategy that seeks to densify, whether to create more vibrant commercial neighborhoods, safer streets, or lower GHG emissions.    The Weequahic neighborhood pilot took place over three weeks in Newark, NJ. The pilot represents a first attempt to develop a new community engagement strategy to support the housing and transportation components of the Newark360 masterplan. It also is an effort to find new ways of talking about density and densification in communities, to try and reframe development and new housing construction as an empowering and community-led process as part of a bigger agenda of densification, GHG emissions reduction, affordability, and economic vibrancy.  Based on several factors, including the existence of active community groups and the presence of an ongoing redevelopment plan, the team selected the Weequahic neighborhood in the South Ward as the site to pilot this new methodology.  Census data indicates that Weequahic is a neighborhood in the midst of a slow demographic transition. The population is shrinking, but new households are still being formed, and this is stimulating the construction of some new housing. This new housing is being built despite a high vacancy rate and a high rate of abandonment. The neighborhood is also shifting from a fairly homogenous group of older owners and renters with large households, to a younger group, with smaller households, that is more mixed and less likely to own their homes.  Community engagements for master planning are often centered on open community meetings where city officials present information about the plan and then record community feedback. For this project, the team decided to focus on education and data, first by conducting a survey, then by providing basic background information about the land use planning and zoning rules in the neighborhood, and then by listening to participate responses in order to identify values, assets, and concerns. The team would then respond to those concerns with tailored ideas that attempted to address them. Rather than focusing on general issues, the goal of the pilot was to gather specific, informed responses to those tailored ideas. When specific options are presented, the community can give feedback that is also specific, increasing the likelihood that their needs and their vision will be fully reflected in the final product.     The Weequahic pilot consisted of a survey and two community workshops. The first workshop was focused on education about zoning and land use, and identification of key community values, assets and concerns about housing and transportation. The second workshop was a deep-dive approach to specific feedback. The pilot yielded the following insights about housing and transportation in the Weequahic neighborhood:  Weequahic primarily consists of 2 and 3-family homes, and most residents (like most residents of Newark) are renters. Survey data indicated high demand for new studio and 1-bedroom apartments. Census data indicated new household formation, increasing the need for housing units of all types. Despite this, there was strong opposition from workshop participants to the development of new housing, and to the development of new affordable housing in particular. Concerns were focused on parking, access to green space, crime and safety, redevelopment of vacant lots, and the appearance of the neighborhood. Participants identified single-family housing as a key asset in their neighborhood, in part because of its spaciousness and appearance.  Participants also identified owner-occupied homes, well-maintained homes, and safe streets as key considerations. Participants expressed a desire for more vibrant neighborhood businesses, but not at the expense of less parking and more traffic. Some participants expressed concerns about affordability, while others expressed concerns about seeing the neighborhood characterized as low-income. Transportation access, particularly bus safety and more night buses, was a major priority in street surveys, but was not considered a major concern for workshop participants. Townhouses and ADUs emerged as possible avenues for new housing in the neighborhood.   The first two engagements under this stage of the Newark360 masterplan, undertaken as a pilot of a new engagement approach around housing and transportation, yielded important information about the proper way to empower communities to make affirmative choices about new housing and development in their neighborhoods.
