<AbstractNarration>The ability to rapidly and accurately detect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is imperative in managing the current global outbreak.  In response to this critical need, the research groups of Prof. Tao and Prof. Steinmetz at the University of California, San Diego will collaborate to develop sensitive diagnostic tests that are easy to perform at the point-of-care.  The project aims to enable 1) direct detection of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) without the need of RNA amplification; and 2) a sensitive immunoassay at the earlier stages of infection.  This project provides interdisciplinary research training opportunities to a postdoctoral researcher, undergraduates, and graduate students.  In addition, it promotes teaching and learning by incorporating novel insights from this research into the NanoEngineering undergraduate and graduate curriculum and summarizing the findings in lay terms in videos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team seeks to develop an innovative metasurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (mSERS) sensing platform for detecting coronavirus infection.  Nanoscale optical cavities are uniquely designed to enhance the sensitivity of optical detection by increasing both the local optical field strengths of hot spots and the hot spot area for sampling a large number of analyte molecules in the cavity.  The quantitative readout of Raman scattering intensity for a single vibrational band can be performed using a commercial benchtop spectrometer.  Integration of this highly sensitive mSERS optical technique with vertical flow, lateral flow, or dipstick devices enables fast, straightforward sample preparation and easy-to-perform testing.  This versatile platform can be used for multiplex detection of nucleic acid (RNA and DNA), antigens/antibodies, or biomarkers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
