<AbstractNarration>Plants experience many stresses, including extreme temperatures, drought, and ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light is a harmful to DNA and proteins. In flowering plants, pollen is particularly susceptible to UV damage, but dark pigments in flower petals may protect the pollen by absorbing UV light. The intensity of UV light reaching Earth has increased greatly during the 20th century and may continue to increase, especially in some regions. This project explores whether protective pigmentation in flowers has increased in response to increasing amounts of UV light.  Because flower color is important for attracting pollinators, understanding how it may have changed is necessary to understand how effectiveness of pollination may also have changed.  Pollination effectiveness, in turn, is important for the economic success of many agricultural crops and for the ecological well-being of all flowering plants. This project will also provide research experiences and mentoring for students from underrepresented groups, and will engage the general public through outreach activities at multiple events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will test the prediction that temporal increases in UV-B radiation have driven increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation in the petals of flowers. Because UV-B has increased most in polar and temperate regions during the last century, they predict that species with polar and temperate distributions will display larger increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation than sub-tropical species. Additionally, the researchers will test the prediction that species with pollen-bearing structures exposed to sunlight will respond to changes in UV-B, while those with pollen structures recessed within the flower (protected) will not. Researchers will use herbarium specimens and bioclimatic databases to gather data on flower pigmentation and abiotic conditions for 75 diverse taxa with different geographic distributions. They will also sample color across a 55-year time span and will use comparative models to assess whether rapid changes in UV-B have elicited rapid change in flower coloration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Due to rapid ongoing global change in the Anthropocene, gaining an understanding of how organisms respond to altered environments is crucial for the persistence of wild and domesticated biodiversity. Largely sessile organisms, like plants, can be subject to harsh light or thermal environments that reduce their performance. However, a number of mechanisms have evolved to mitigate abiotic stress. For example, pollen, which transfers male gametes of flowering plants can be degraded by ultraviolet (UV) exposure, but elevated UV-absorbing pigmentation of flowers may protect pollen from UV-B damage. Across kingdoms, elevated pigmentation is a common response to UV exposure. &nbsp;</p> <p>During the 1900s, global ozone levels declined rapidly, resulting in elevated UV exposure. How can we test whether and how organisms have respond to recent changes in UV exposure? One approach that is gaining momentum is the use of museum specimens that contain data on traits that specimens possessed at the time of collection. We used a retrospective approach to investigate whether floral UV pigmentation responded to global change over the course of ~75 years in 42 taxa distributed across 3 continents.</p> <p>We selected over 1200 herbarium specimens (pressed plant specimens with detailed information on where and when the plant was collected) to measure floral UV pigmentation with UV-sensitive cameras. Specimens were collected from the late 1940s to present and represented species from Australia, Eurasia, and North America. We used climate databases to determine ozone levels and temperature at the time each plant was collected. We additionally scored plant traits like floral shape because in some species pollen is already protected from UV by the petals but in other species, pollen is exposed to ambient light levels when the petals open. We predicted that 1) plants would increase in UV absorbing floral pigmentation over time, 2) pigmentation would be linked directly with ozone levels such that pigmentation would be elevated under lower ozone (higher UV), and 3) if species varied in how much pigmentation changed over time, it would be linked with how much ozone changed across that species? range. We also predicted that flowers with exposed pollen would respond more strongly to ozone than those with protected pollen.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;We found that, across all species, there was a significant increase in pigmentation over time. That is, flowers got 'darker' in the UV spectrum in general. However, while the flowers of some species increased in pigmentation, others showed little change, and some even became less pigmented. That is, responses to global change differed among species. Species with exposed pollen displayed the predicted relationship with ozone, whereby pigmentation was elevated under reduced ozone levels. This however, was not the case for species with pollen protected within flowers. The magnitude of ozone decline that a species experienced over time was strongly linked with the magnitude of flower pigmentation change for species with exposed pollen (Fig. 2 A, pollen exposed). Species that experienced larger declines in ozone increased more in floral UV pigmentation. Interestingly, species with concealed pollen that experienced larger increases in temperature over the 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century declined in floral UV pigmentation (Fig. 2B, pollen concealed).&nbsp; This result suggests that flower pigmentation may play a role in thermoregulation for species with pollen concealed within petal tissue. Overall, our study documented rapid change in floral UV coloration that is linked with anthropogenic climate change. And, it showed that the severity of climatic change in ozone and temperature are strong predictors of the degree to with flower color changed over time. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>This grant contributed to the training of a number of undergraduate researchers at three Universities (Clemson University, University of Virginia, University of Pittsburgh) that participated in this project by geo-referencing herbarium records, using ultraviolet photography, and performing digital image analyses. The Koski Lab at Clemson is working to create an exhibit to highlight this research and the plant collection of the Clemson University Herbarium. This exhibit will be part of the Department of Biological Sciences' newly renovated Campbell Natural History Museum and will engage visitors in botanical research and an understanding of how climate change affects native plants.
