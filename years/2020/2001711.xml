<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the triennial international conference "Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM 2020)" held in Vancouver, BC, Canada on June 15-24, 2020. Computational mathematics is increasingly important in all branches of science and engineering, and increasing computational power has radically changed the relationship between mathematics and computation. The Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM) Society is an international nonprofit organization that supports and promotes research at the interface of mathematics and computation and fosters interaction among mathematics, computer science, and other areas of computational science.  The FoCM 2020 conference is expected to attract an estimated 500 participants, including at least 150 junior participants (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty), with perhaps 100 of these from the US.  This award provides partial funding for some US participants, particularly junior participants who might otherwise not be able to attend. It will advance the international exposure of research conducted in the US and will have lasting effects in the form of new collaborations between US and international participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference comprises three 3-day sessions of 7 workshops each (21 total), combined with plenary and semi-plenary talks each day.  Besides the plenary speakers, each workshop will have two semi-plenary speakers. Workshops span a wide range of computational mathematics topics, with ties to pure mathematics, computer science, data science, scientific computing, and other related fields. For more information, see &lt;br/&gt;http://focm-society.org/2020/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The conference was cancelled due to COVID-19 and all funds were returned to NSF.   The 10th international conference in the series Foundations of Computational Mathematics, FoCM 2020, would have been hosted in Vancouver, BC, June 15&ndash;24, 2020. The next iteration of this conference is scheduled from 2023 and the tentative plans are to hold this conference in the Vancouver area, and to re-apply for NSF support at that time.   The FoCM conferences are organized by the Society for the Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM), and have established themselves as the main vehicle in the exploration of the broad interface between mathematics and contemporary computation, a subject area of tremendous importance both intellectually and for applications. They have also demonstrated a reputation for scholarly excellence, without an equal in computational mathematics.    The impact of constantly increasing computational power has changed the relationship between mathematics and computation.  New applications such as encryption, large scale data management, and signal/image processing, inevitably led to the study of the computational tools themselves, creating and reinvigorating a rich spectrum of mathematical disciplines. Mathematicians now increasingly recognize that, besides its value as a numerical and experimental tool, computation is a significant theoretical tool in its own right, an important object of mathematical study, and an exciting source of new mathematical problems. The FoCM conference series aims to further the understanding of the connections between mathematics and computation, including the interfaces between pure and applied mathematics, numerical analysis and computer science.
