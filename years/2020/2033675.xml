<AbstractNarration>Freight is predominantly transported via heavy-duty road vehicles and container shipping vessels.  The heavy loads characteristic of each of these transportation modes require high-density fuels sources.  That restriction, in combination with the impracticality of recharging batteries aboard marine vessels, will limit the penetration of electric vehicles into these markets for the near term.  Therefore, diesel fuel consumption by heavy-duty road vehicle and marine engines is expected to continue to rise. This research project investigates how low greenhouse gas emissions technologies can be used to support this increasing use of diesel fuels. Combustion and catalysis research are combined to understand the impact of fuel composition and combustion strategy on the emissions of greenhouse gases - namely, nitrous oxide, methane, and diesel particulates. In addition, several current diesel fuels, including biorenewable ones, are evaluated to assess various scenarios for reducing the overall global warming potential of diesel-type fuels and the corresponding combustion strategies. The outcomes of this project will contribute to U.S. leadership in clean diesel technology. The project also will provide cross-disciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students, while emphasizing increased participation by underrepresented minorities in STEM fields at all educational levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research project is to track the chemical relationships between fuel composition, combustion products, and exhaust emissions on the overall global warming potential of heavy-duty diesel-type compression-ignition engines.  The research aims include 1) the construction of an optically-accessible reactor to study combustion of vaporized diesel, biodiesel, and surrogate fuels under conditions relevant for low temperature combustion engines; 2) the use of novel, in-situ techniques to measure temperature, hydrocarbon species and particulate formation throughout the combustion reaction zone; 3) the determination of the nitrous oxide formation mechanism over an exhaust oxidation catalyst; and 4) the integration of results via life cycle analysis to evaluate the global warming potential of various diesel and diesel-alternatives. The types of fuels to be evaluated include standard fossil fuel diesel plus three classes of “low carbon” diesel alternatives, namely soy biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, FAME), “green diesel” from the thermochemical conversion of waste biomass, and “carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels” produced using reclaimed carbon dioxide as feedstock. Using the optically accessible combustion chamber and a new time- and frequency-resolved nonlinear spectroscopy measurement method, species will be measured as a function of the fuel type and combustion mode.  Standard diesel engine combustion conditions will be compared with low temperature combustion conditions relevant to homogenous charge compression ignition and premixed-charged compression ignition. The mechanism of nitrous oxide formation over a diesel oxidation catalyst as a function of hydrocarbon type will be derived via experiments and computational modeling. A life cycle analysis will be performed combining the nitrous oxide, methane, particulate and carbon dioxide results for each fuel type, such that an overall perspective of fuel source and combustion mode impact can be evaluated. The outcomes of this research project will allow the community and public policy decision makers to better understand how diesel fuel source and combustion technologies can deliver meaningful reductions in the global warming potential of diesel-type fuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
