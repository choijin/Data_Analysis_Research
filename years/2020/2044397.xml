<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by improving physics and environmental science teaching and learning through evidence-based curriculum and pedagogy with undergraduate, non-science majors, including undergraduate elementary teacher candidates.  The American University general education program includes five Habits of Mind course requirements in which Natural-Scientific Inquiry is one of the areas.  This project will revise two science courses that meet this requirement.  Through this IUSE Level 1 Engaged Student Learning project, these two courses will be revised to include problem-based learning, as well as to align course content with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  A key feature of this project is the faculty development dimension associated with implementing the research-based pedagogical strategies in the revised courses.  Thus, this project intends to create and test a replicable model of physics and environmental science instruction at a medium-sized, urban, private research university to improve the quality and effectiveness of undergraduate teaching in physics and environmental science, as well as to improve undergraduate STEM teaching and learning for non-STEM majors including preservice teacher candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three project goals.  One is to revise existing introductory, non-majors’ physics and environmental science coursework to include NGSSs-aligned interdisciplinary, problem-based learning opportunities. The courses will be revised with the support of the University’s Center on Research, Teaching, &amp; Learning and the project leadership team. The redesign of the courses will begin in the spring and summer of 2022. Participating faculty will receive support and guidance in backward design and research on learning sciences to enhance their course content and build problem-based instruction into the identified courses.  Another goal is to support faculty to enact the revised coursework through summer professional development that includes participating faculty and the teaching assistants of each course. Finally, the project aims to assess and analyze the outcomes of the work through syllabus analysis, observations of instruction, interviews with faculty, and assessment of student outcomes through surveys and focus groups. The project’s research questions focus on students’ science subject matter knowledge, motivation to learn science, and perceptions and preparedness to teach science to elementary students. The research plan uses publicly available, published instruments.  The project has the potential to add to the knowledge of how interdisciplinary, problem-based teaching and learning in physics and environmental science could support the science learning of non-STEM majors, including preservice teacher candidates. By enhancing science literacy with students who are not majoring in a STEM discipline, this project can benefit society at large.  Moreover, improving the subject area knowledge of future elementary teachers should support improved science instruction in elementary classrooms. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports creating, exploring, and implementing promising practices and tools. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) Program is providing co-funding for this IUSE: EHR project to support the project's pre-service teacher preparation goals, which are well-aligned with Noyce Program goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
