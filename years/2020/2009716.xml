<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the quality of life for patients on long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) as a result of chronic lung diseases through improved oxygen technology. Over 1 million Americans require LTOT to manage symptoms of hypoxemia and shortness of breath due to chronic lung disease. Although portable oxygen equipment exists, such as oxygen tanks or portable oxygen concentrators (POCs), many patients are faced with limitations with their equipment (oxygen duration, size and weight of devices, quantity of oxygen). More than a quarter of all oxygen users experience such challenges, severely affecting mobility, the ability to work and travel, and ultimately affecting quality of life. Improved technology in portable oxygen equipment can drastically improve the everyday lives of patients with the opportunity to rethink the current standards in managing oxygen delivery and improve patient care and quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project proposes novel oxygen delivery and management technology to improve the efficiency and efficacy of current POC technology. The proposed system incorporates a new delivery modality of mixed high-flow air with oxygen to increase the treatable range of oxygen flow rates while providing additional dyspnea relief. The proposed system also automatically titrates oxygen delivery based on patient needs (SpO2) to limit oxygen waste and increase efficiency of current POCs. Current research is investigating the safety and efficacy of the novel flow modality and automatic titration in patients through multiple in-human studies. Preliminary results suggest a potential increase in exercise capacity over standard LTOT and a decrease in shortness of breath with the novel flow modality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
