<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is to advance the development of a novel system for abdominal minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The proposed procedure will be a safer, cleaner, and more efficient method of removing tissue specimens, such as a uterine fibroid, uterus, kidney or spleen, through a small incision. Existing MIS methods and instruments are not yet optimized for the removal of the separated tissue from the cavity without enlarging an incision or limiting the surgeon's visualization and maneuverability. The proposed method will use novel, safer and more efficient instruments developed for the removal of large tissue specimens via MIS. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will explore translation of an integrated power morcellator and containment system for cutting and removing large tissue specimens from inside a cavity without subsequent contamination. The proposed project is to conduct tests with standard MIS equipment, including a 5mm 30 degree angled laparoscope, laparoscopic camera, light source and monitor, and a CO2 rapid insufflator. The specimens to be cut will be beef tongue and potato, which is representative of a fibroid uterus. The proposed project will inform a surgical protocol to 1) improve safety and efficiency, and 2) prevent cavity contamination by the removed tissue.  The simulator and trocar sleeves will be evaluated for traces of tissue contamination using the highly-precise ATP test. The project will explore the parameter space associated with the procedure, including the maximum time the power morcellator is in the on position, blade temperatures, and cavity pressure; as well as post-procedure examinations of the blades and shaft for cracks and fatigue fractures; and of the containers for abrasions, punctures and leaks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
