<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of safe automotive transportation in inclement weather. This project is based on the development of advanced computer vision algorithms that provide more reliable driving information in inclement weather. The improvements in vehicle operation from commercialization of this technology may directly lower the number of accidents. This technology will lower insurance costs and payouts as it minimizes risk and increases the safety of passengers. The goal of this project is to add the proposed technology to the current Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) functionality; i.e., include the new abilities alongside other automotive applications such as blind spot monitoring, lane-keep assistance, and forward collision warnings.  In addition, this technology may help to advance the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Due to the flexibility of implementation, it is expected that there may be a significant impact on the automotive transportation community over the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of advanced computer vision algorithms that provide more reliable driving information in inclement weather. Using a camera as the proposed sensor input, combined with proprietary computer vision algorithms, it is possible to provide the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) with a drivable region on snow-covered roads. The proposed computer vision software was developed from research conducted on how to improve autonomous vehicle performance in adverse weather conditions. This research supports the development of proprietary image processing, image filtering, and machine learning techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project resulted in a feasible means for commercializaing automated vehicle technology that works in adverse weather. Initially it was thought that autonomous vehicle companies would be our targeted partners for commercialization but we learned that vehicle automation technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have an established market and provide an ideal opportunity for our technology. A validated business model canvas was developed, 120+ customer discover interviews were conducted, the Total Available Market / Serviceable&nbsp;Available&nbsp;Market / Serviceable Obtainable Market were identified, the requirements for a Minimum Viable Product were idendified, the commercial ecosystem was identified, and the next steps to continue commercialization were identified. Our team had a traditional engineering background and from completion of this project, we now have the latest cutting-edge business skills focused on creating a lean start-up. With this foundation our team is well positioned for successful establishment of a viable commercial business. We have now been awarded local state funding and have registered our business. Our next steps are to develop our minimum viable product and earn our first commercial contract. By enablishing this business, technology that achieves safe operation of vehicles in adverse weather can become available to the general public.</p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-371bb164-7fff-49b7-aa0e-f23c17f80b0f"> </span></p> <div><span><br /></span></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/19/2021<br>      Modified by: Zachary&nbsp;D&nbsp;Asher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
