<AbstractNarration>The new IEEE IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS) Conference, a merger of The IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) and the IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO), is a premier conference in the fields of autonomic computing, self-adaptation and self-organization.  The conference, to be held online in August 2020, brings together researchers and industry practitioners to develop self-adapting, self-organizing, and automatic systems for addressing a number of challenges in the field, for example developing novel modeling techniques for interactions between local and global behaviors.  The project will support a diverse array of students to participate in the doctoral symposium at the conference, to engage deeply with the ACSOS research community.  The students will also have the opportunity to participate in all other conference activities, which are being modified to an online format.  The project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, to promote the progress of science as it provides a forum to disseminate research efforts, connect researchers, and train the next generation of scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will focus on various underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  For the doctoral symposium, students will attend oral and poster presentations of research projects, and participate in a professional training and career development session to receive advice from experts in the field. That session will include tips on conducting research efficiently and ethically, writing and presenting research papers, seeking jobs in leading industry and academia after graduation, and realizing long-term professional and academic objectives. The funding provided by NSF will have a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of researchers in autonomic computing, while encouraging diversity in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
