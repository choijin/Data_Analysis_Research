<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel smartphone-based method for symptom monitoring and screening for chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Current methods of evaluating respiratory diseases are not easily accessible or do not scale to screen large populations. The proposed technology will enable detection and monitoring of respiratory diseases to anyone with access to an internet-connected microphone (e.g., smartphone), using voice as an indicator.  The technology will administer simple tests in minutes and deliver results in seconds, without requiring specialized user training. The anticipated outcome is a widespread, real-time screening, monitoring and exacerbation warning system that remotely analyzes voice signals for patients with chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop voice-based classifiers that diagnose COVID-19 and monitor the severity of the disease. Existing algorithms that detect vocal biomarkers in breath and speech indicative of lung function and respiratory disease will be extended to incorporate COVID-19 signatures. Audio recordings from patients receiving a positive COVID-19 test will be collected to extract micro -signatures and develop algorithms to automatically recognize and map patterns to clinical findings and reported symptoms. The research objectives include developing: (1) A binary classifier that differentiates symptomatic and asymptomatic patients; (2) A multi-class classifier that correlates (in future predicts) changes in the severity of a patient’s symptoms when provided a series of voice samples (3) Developing a dashboard for physicians that provides up to date reports and visualizations of the cross sectional and longitudinal analytics (4) An API giving lung function metrics and classifiers available for integration into 3rd party IT infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Background:  Respiratory diseases like Asthma and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) place a huge burden on society in terms of disability, premature mortality, and drugs prescribed and cost the US economy more than $130 billion per year. Furthermore, approximately one third of COVID-19 survivors with severe or critical disease are likely to have significant long-term lung-related complications that can resemble chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Periodic assessment of these diseases is needed to determine and assess impact on a patient’s health status, risk of future exacerbations, hospital admissions, mortality and to help guide therapy.   According to the gold standard in respiratory care, two lung function metricts FEV1 (Forced Expiratory volume in one second) and FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) as measured by traditional spirometry are used for diagnosis, and self reported patient symptoms are used for staging and treating the disease. Spirometry-based lung function is globally underutilized, leading to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. There are no automated tools for measuring and monitoring respiratory symptoms. There is an urgent and unmet need to develop non-invasive tools to monitor lung-function in this ever growing population of patients, with the goal of enabling early and aggressive treatment for patients at greatest risk for severe respiratory exacerbation. We tackle this critical need in our project by combining vocal biomarkers along with machine learning models as indicators of lung function.   Hypothesis and Goal: Voice is an important biomarker of many medical conditions including diseases of the respiratory system which leave signatures in breath and speech. Voice and breath sounds can be used to assess the severity of respiratory lung infections and chronic lung diseases. Using COPD as our first indication, the goal of this project was to create a COPD Early Exacerbation warning system by detecting and predicting early exacerbation for COPD patients.   Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study correlating voice and breath samples to lung function. We collected audio recordings from participants at a large suburban general hospital in Western Pennsylvania over the course of a year. We recorded audio samples on a commodity smart tablet, using proprietary software and analyzed recorded data off-line on the secure Telling.ai cloud. We extracted audio features from the recordings and developed algorithms to predict gold standard lung function measurements FEV1 and FVC, and to map changes in voice to changes in respiratory symptoms and predict an exacerbation upto a week in advance.   Specific Outcomes: Our algorithms are diagnostically accurate and statistically significant for measuring the gold standard key lung function measurements FEV1 and FVC. We demonstrated that changes in voice and breath correlate strongly with changes in symptoms and furthermore, that signatures in voice can be detected even before the symptoms present themselves. We also developed a dashboard for health care providers that provides up to date reports and visualizations of our analytics, along with an API that makes our core lung function metrics and classifiers available, so that the dashboard functionality can be integrated into the hospital's IT infrastructure.     Clinical Implications: This technology requires no additional custom-built hardware, is cost effective, non-invasive and practical for ubiquitous and frequent use on mobile phones.  The solution is ideally suited for personalized, predictive and frequent monitoring to enable the development of clinical decision support systems. This technique offers the promise of early interventions to reduce exacerbation frequency and severity, advancing personalized medicine for chronic and acute respiratory care.
