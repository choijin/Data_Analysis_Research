<AbstractNarration>NRT-URoL: Molecular Probes and Sensors for Complex Environments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex chemical and physical mixtures influence important processes related to agriculture, technology, and human health. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to the University of Oregon will address the central challenge of developing molecular sensors and probes that are needed to understand these processes and address complex problems in biology and the environment. The project will support a unique program for graduate Master’s and PhD students that will provide training in the scientific areas of molecular probes and sensors, technological development, and data analysis. When combined, these areas will generate new methods of detecting and controlling small molecules in complex media. This program will also prepare graduate students to enter a challenging, changing future with a training plan that combines market-aligned research and innovation training, inclusive leadership practices, and immersive team-led projects. A total of 150 Master’s and PhD students will be involved in the program, including 25 NSF-supported PhD students. The combination of elements in this training program will produce a cohort of scientists who are uniquely prepared to address societal needs in diverse and dynamic workforce environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will catalyze research to solve complex problems in environmental and life sciences arenas by developing synthetic molecular probes and novel devices. Major themes include: (a) Molecular sensors for analytes in complex environments; implantable chemFET sensors for regenerative biology; autonomous, self-contained sensors for real-time environmental monitoring; (b) Chemical tools for interrogating biological processes, including novel carbon nanohoops for multiplexed and multimodal biological imaging and multiplexed approaches to address the roles of reactive sulfur species in biology. Each of these themes brings together synthetic chemistry, sensing and detection, and analysis of complex data, all of which will be supported by the training environment. Trainees in this program will participate in a professional development series focusing on inclusive practices necessary to succeed in a diverse collaborative environment. Scientific and technical skills will be provided through targeted modules on chemical biology, device synthesis, biological models, and data analysis, as well as mentored ‘immersion laboratories’ designed in collaboration with industrial partners. In addition, all trainees will participate in a Lens of the Market professional development program that provides a mechanism to align fundamental science with market needs, provide strong professional development, and launch student careers. Successful elements of the NRT, as identified through rigorous evaluation, will be institutionalized at UO and shared with the broader academic community to provide a model for translating this training program to other disciplines or research areas. &lt;br/&gt;…………………….&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
