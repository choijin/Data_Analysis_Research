<AbstractNarration>The interplay between number theory and algebraic geometry has been a source of inspiration in modern mathematics. Having led to the solution of a number of outstanding conjectures, such as Fermat's Last Theorem and the Mordell Conjecture, it continues to give rise to deep and important problems in algebra. Local-global principles are a central theme in this interplay of subjects, and many important outstanding problems can be expressed in terms of such principles. This project has the objective of understanding local-global principles and their obstructions, in contexts that are broader than those considered in number theory. The project will also support and enhance the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers through seminars, conferences and workshops, and mentoring activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Focused Research Group will focus on local-global principles for algebraic structures defined over function fields of curves over base fields such as p-adic fields, with a longer term goal of treating the case of function fields of curves over global fields. The obstructions to such local-global principles can often be formulated in terms of cohomology. Our project aims to study the finiteness of these obstructions and determine criteria for them to vanish. The resulting understanding will be applied to proving conjectures and solving open problems concerning algebraic structures such as quadratic forms and associative algebras. This will include situations that have been studied by many researchers but where solutions had previously seemed out of reach. Research methods will include field patching, cohomological methods including residues and duality, and approaches from geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project, in the area of algebra, has had the objective of understanding local-global principles and their obstructions, in contexts that are broader than those considered in number theory. Building on recent breakthroughs, we have focused on the case of semiglobal fields, which are function fields of curves defined over complete discretely valued base fields such as p-adic fields.  As it evolved over the course of the funding period, this became a rich story which involved a range of topics from local-global principles used in understanding the structure of algebraic objects, to rationality questions of algebraic groups, as well as the combinatorics of degenerations of families of smooth curves. Applications included local-global principles zero-cycles on homogeneous varieties, for the structure of absolute Galois groups and for torsors for certain linear algebraic groups.   Mentoring of graduate students and young researchers, and building new connections between researchers was also an essential part of the activities. Along these lines, the project involved the training of graduate students in ways that went beyond the usual activities, by bringing them into the collaborative research efforts, workshops and conferences.   In addition, the project activities also involved other conferences aimed at a wider audience of active researchers, and still others featured small focused research groups.
