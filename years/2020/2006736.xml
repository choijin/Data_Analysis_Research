<AbstractNarration>Vortices are ubiquitous in fluids. We observe swirls in rivers, the ocean, and hurricanes. The main objective of this project is to understand how such vortices interact with each other; more specifically, what kind of geometric patterns they can form in nature. A simple example is how the triangle formed by the centers of three hurricanes changes its shape in time; it is a mathematical model for the three hurricanes, Irma, Jose, and Katia, that appeared near the Gulf of Mexico in the Fall 2017, shortly after the Hurricane Harvey. Such interacting vortices are known to appear in much smaller scales in certain materials as well, and are key to the understanding of superconductors, which have engineering applications including powerful electromagnets (used for maglev trains, fusion reactors, and magnetic resonance imaging). This project exploits mathematical ideas to better understand the dynamics of interacting vortices. The project will contribute to outreach events, and the PI and the graduate students will also mentor undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds participating in a mathematical modeling contest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates interactions of multiple vortices in ordinary fluids, superfluids, and superconductors using modern geometric methods to study how the configuration of vortices evolves in time. While the shape dynamics of only a few vortices is well understood, the shape dynamics of a larger number of vortices has been a challenge. The new geometric insight sheds a new light on the shape dynamics of vortices by finding invariants that will help us understand the stability of possible configurations. The project develops techniques to analyze the shape dynamics of vortices by exploiting ideas from symmetry reduction in the geometric approach to mechanics. The technique applies not only to vortices in ordinary fluids but also to quantum vortices in superfluids and superconductors. The project also develops numerical methods to accurately predict stability/instability of configurations of many vortices. Vortex dynamics is a practical example of so-called non-separable Hamiltonian systems, to which many conventional explicit methods for Hamiltonian systems do not apply directly. The project aims to develop explicit numerical integrators for non-separable Hamiltonian systems with favorable geometric properties, such as exact/near conservation of invariants in vortex dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
