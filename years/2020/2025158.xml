<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS) at Harvard University was created with a clear vision to provide a collaborative multi-disciplinary research environment to support world-class nanoscience and technical expertise, for the community of researchers from academia and industry. The goals of CNS are: Facilitating leading-edge research and education in the fabrication, imaging, and characterization of nanoscale structures across the disciplines of applied physics, biology, chemistry, electrical engineering, geology, materials science, medicine and physics; Creating a collabortive nanotechnology community by providing shared instrumentation facilities and infrastructure, expert staff, synergistic meeting places, and educational opportunities conducive to productive scientific engagement.  As the New England hub of the NSF National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI), the focus of the technical team is to develop specialized tools, processes, instrumentation, and expertise to help design, characterize, and fabricate novel materials, nanostructures, devices, and systems, that go beyond conventional approaches. CNS pushes the envelope of Quantum Science and Engineering.  CNS offers tools for nanofabrication, electron microscopy, and characterization of nanoscale systems, with technical expertise and assistance provided by its staff. CNS is one of the most active nanofabrication and imaging facilities in the world. With its diverse user base, well-established infrastructure, and outstanding facilities, CNS is well placed to continue as a technology leader. In addition, CNS plays a key role training the nation's next generation of scientists and engineers. It has an established Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, as well as an annual summer nanotechnology seminar series. A CNS Scholars Program will bring in underrepresented researchers, and an internship program will train U.S. veterans in nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Since its creation in 2001, CNS has become a key nanotechnology resource for the nation. CNS has developed diverse and versatile facilities including multi-length-scale optical and electron-beam lithography, focused ion beam (FIB) and reactive ion etch (RIE) systems to shape structures quantum devices and photonic structures, and soft lithography expertise to enable fabrication of a wide variety of microfluidic systems and devices for translational bioscience. These tools allow users to push the frontiers of quantum engineering, nanoscale electronics and photonics using nontraditional materials, and they enable the development of sensor systems for biomedicine. CNS researchers pursue advanced topics including quantum science, plasmonics, diamond photonics, nanoscale sensors, and atomic-layer devices. CNS has an outstanding suite of imaging and characterization tools including an aberration-corrected STEM, a high resolution TEM, a CryoTEM, and an Atom Probe for 3D tomography, as well as scanned probe microscopes, and linear and non-linear optical microscopes. Its characterization tools permit detailed analysis and assessment of materials, components, and systems, providing researchers with a comprehensive platform for quantum technology and nanotechnology research. CNS focuses on advancing world-class nanotechnology research, fostering the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit, developing and sustaining educational resources to develop a skilled nanotechnology workforce, and supporting the evolving infrastructure and advanced tools needed to support excellence in quantum science and nanotechnology research and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
