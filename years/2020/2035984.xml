<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to extend advanced encapsulation technologies to allow successful delivery of new biological treatments on the skin.  Research has proven the beneficial effects of applying living probiotics directly to skin, and there are emerging needs to deliver such probiotics alive in topical creams. However, applications of biologics are currently limited because of the challenges associated with its inactivation/decomposition during production, transport, storage, which often lead to low delivery efficacy and constraints in product type. Additionally, current biologic-containing products often have short shelf-life and high refrigeration cost. This project will create a robust encapsulation platform tailored toward delivering living probiotics in topical skin formulations featuring long storage capabilities, while providing critical methods for prospective biologic-related applications. This project will enable novel biologic therapeutic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop solutions to prolong probiotics’ survival in complex water-oil skin formulations utilizing microencapsulation technology.  Multiple studies have validated the advantageous effect of active probiotics for skin health; however, development of topical probiotic products remains a great challenge as the probiotics must remain active and viable within formulations during long storage periods. To mitigate such challenges, this proposal will focus on integrity-enhanced microstructures that can encase, immobilize and sustain living-probiotic cells in a highly moisturized environment. Different types of probiotic-enriched skin moisturizer formulations will be developed, and the viability and stability of probiotics will be studied under accelerated storage conditions. Specifically, this project will improve the stability and viability of probiotics in skincare formulations by carrying out detailed analysis on: (1) the processing parameters and operating temperatures to encase probiotics; (2) developing formulations using suitable probiotic-friendly ingredients; (3) the stabilities of the microencapsulation microstructures and probiotic compatibility; (4) probiotic viabilities stored under different pH and temperature conditions; (5) probiotics’ interaction with antimicrobial agents; and (6) the release and delivery of probiotics from the formulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
