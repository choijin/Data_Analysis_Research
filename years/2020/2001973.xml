<AbstractNarration>The study of birds (Ornithology) tends to be divided among many scientific societies that each focus on birds of one or two countries. This is a problem because birds are found almost everywhere and move great distances in migration. They ignore national borders. Scientists from different countries who study birds (ornithologists) would thus benefit from working more together. This is hard to achieve because travel to distant meetings to form new partnerships can be financially prohibitive, especially for young ornithologists, who are the future of the field.  This project will support travel by students and early career professionals to the 7th North American Ornithological Conference (NAOC) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, 10-15 August, 2020. The conference theme, "Flight Paths Addressing Global Challenges", and its Caribbean location will bring together ornithologists from across North, Central and South America. They will meet to talk about many topics, including migration, conservation, ecology and evolution. Scientific highlights will include a keynote address by a famous ornithologist, plenary talks, and four days of presentations on a wide variety of topics. The conference will attract many participants from Puerto Rico, who are often unable to afford meetings in the continental United States. There will be five mentoring activities, about 20 workshops targeted at young participants, and involvement of the public in multiple activities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will help fund travel of more than 60 participants. Funds from NSF will augment funds already provided by the convening societies, to leverage an extraordinary level of participation by ornithologists from Latin America and the Caribbean. Many of them will be joining participants from North American ornithological societies for the first time. More than 1,300 attendees are expected, representing academia, non-profit organizations, and diverse government agencies, and including eight ornithological societies from North America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and the New World Tropics.  Several initiatives in this conference build on lessons from previous ornithological conferences to instill trust and develop infrastructure necessary to coordinate understanding and protection of birds, and the environments on which they depend, throughout the Western Hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported the 7th North American Ornithological Conference (NAOC), the first ever all-virtual conference focused on birds and their conservation. The specific goal was to support participation by students and early professionals, and to expand intellectual participation from traditionally North American-dominated conferences to include as many Latin American and Caribbean ornithologists as possible, representing the diversity of ornithologists in terms of ethnicity, race, gender and gender-identification, and economic sector.  Diverse intellectual findings, accomplishments, and products resulted from conference:  NAOC 2020 Virtual far exceeded original participation expectations overall: A total of 2,932 attended, the largest ornithological conference of record due to its accessibility online. This conference provided all intellectual content of traditional, in-person conferences, and more: a keynote lecture, four plenary sessions featuring six outstanding early professional and more established ornithologists, five days of concurrent paper/symposium sessions, four evenings of concurrent networking events, two evenings of concurrent poster sessions, and opening and closing events. Two invited speakers, both African American, emphasized how to increase diversity within Ornithology, particularly by facilitating opportunities for those poorly represented to date: Jamila Blake (Professional Development Director, The Wildlife Society) spoke on "Fostering Inclusive Mentorship in the Conservation Profession," and Tykee James (Government Affairs Coordinator, National Audubon Society) presented on "Inspiration for action: A sustainable way forward for ornithologists and birders in conservation." Participant diversity also far exceeded expectations: Participants represented 74 countries, with 1,741 people from the US and US Territories (including 30 Puerto Ricans), 262 Canadians, 680 from Caribbean, Mexico, and Central and South America (compared to 99 at the previous, in-person NAOC 2016), 66 Europeans, and 72 from other regions (Africa, Asia, Australia, Middle East).

NAOC 2020 Virtual afforded all the usual training opportunities of in-person conferences. The 10 roundtable discussions included "3 Billion Birds Lost&mdash;Now What?," "Bird Friendly Agriculture and Development: What Does Bird-Friendly Mean?," "A Mixed Flock: Diverse Narratives within Ornithology," and "Expanding the Motus Wildlife Tracking Network"; all were well attended (600&minus;1,400 people per session). The five technical and educational workshops were also well attended: "Introduction to Analyzing Count Data in R ‘unmarked’," "eBird Status and Trends," "Working with Data Collected by Citizen Scientists," "Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Ornithology," and "NAOC Meeting 101" (for first-time attendees).   These results and accomplishments emphasize several broader impacts of this conference:  Attendance sky-rocketed, including young ornithologists (students and early professionals) and new audience from Latin America and the Caribbean, both because a virtual conference incurs less venue expenses, travel costs, time, and permission required to attend in-person, and because funds from this proposal provided a tipping point for affordable registration fees.

Both factors also allowed greatly reduced registration fees for more established professional attendees, which facilitated participation from colleagues from the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America, and elsewhere globally. By eliminating travel and other expenses associated with an in-person conference, this first ever all-virtual ornithological conference reduced the carbon footprint associated with travel, especially to a location like Puerto Rico (planned destination pre-COVID19). This conference compelled the organizers to learn multiple new technologies for sharing our science (i Zoom, EventPilot, Slack), to communicate to large audiences through our dedicated website (naocbirds.org) and the extensive use of social media, and to record the scientific sessions, which we made available for 30 days post-conference to all registrants. Participants could&mdash;for the first time&mdash;"attend" sessions that would have been impossible during an in-person conference with concurrent, non-recorded sessions (that have been prohibitively expensive to record in past). All sponsoring and partnering ornithological societies learned pros and cons of a virtual conference, compiling data and assimilating experience with which to make better informed decisions for future conferences. This included technical guidebooks, extensive organizational files, attendance data, and results from an informative post-conference participant survey on a shared drive, greatly to benefit all participating societies in organizing future professional conferences.
