<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to enhance the health of livestock without addition of synthetic antibiotic and antioxidant compounds. The proposed technologies are corn kernel fiber byproducts of ethanol production from corn. The need for such compounds has grown as livestock is now more often raised in concentrated animal feeding operations that confine animals and result in abnormal oxidative stress. The program is based on extracting these naturally occurring compounds from agricultural residues.  These extracts can be used in place of antibiotics and synthetic supplements currently in livestock feeds.  The process proposed will enable production at a cost competitive with synthetic supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR project proposes to assess the biological activity of hydroxy cinnamic acids and their oligomers (HCAs) as beneficial supplements in livestock feed. They are ester-linked to a hemicellulose known to occur in seed crop brans. The linkage is hydrolyzed during pretreatment of corn bran fiber to prepare it for conversion to ethanol and the HCAs dissolve in the pretreatment solution. As free acids they recover their character, which includes antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The project will provide kilogram quantities of HCAs for use in feeding trials with young swine, wherein they will be compared with naturally sourced feed supplements currently in use in Europe, as well as un-supplemented feed. Components of the extract will be identified and comprehensive biochemical analyses performed, including study of the gastrointestinal physiology and intestinal permeability. Studies will also be performed of gut microbiomes and how the processes involved are influenced by substitution of HCAs as the primary feed supplement. Successful completion of these studies will provide a basis for more comprehensive studies of the use of HCAs as supplements in the diet of other livestock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
