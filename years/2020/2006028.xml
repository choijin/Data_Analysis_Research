<AbstractNarration>Understanding, predicting, and controlling the interactions between nanomaterials and biological entities are critical for the development of nanostructures for nanomedicine, facilitating more efficient diagnoses and treatments of diseases. The main goal of this research is to control by magnetic field the nanoscale interactions between the polar ferroelectric surfaces and charged biomolecules by designing and creating hybrid magnetic-ferroelectric nanostructures. These hybrid nanostructures integrate ferroelectric nanomaterials, a class of nanomaterials possessing permanent and controllable electric dipoles (hence are “polar”), together with magnetic materials. This research will clarify how the interactions between the materials are determined by the size and geometry of the nanostructures as well as magnetic field strength.  This will enable the rational design of hybrid magnetic-ferroelectric nanostructures for biological and medical applications, such as remotely-controlled targeted release of drug molecules for cancer treatment, deep brain stimulation for treating Parkinson’s disease, and enhancing cell growth for tissue regeneration. The project provides a broad education experience to all students, including interdisciplinary research training, and participation in an outreach program focusing on the professional development of high-school science teachers. The outreach activities include recruiting teachers to perform project-related research in the investigator’s labs and organizing a two-day workshop “Nano Connections”. This workshop aims to introduce the participants to the advanced research topics and applications of nanomaterials and nanotechnology and develop plans for related classroom activities. Science teachers from rural school districts and underrepresented groups will be actively recruited through collaboration with the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers. Graduate students will be involved as the mentors of the teachers to facilitate a mutual learning experience.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactions between nanomaterials and biological entities are of fundamental importance for many biological and medical applications of nanostructures such as biosensing, drug delivery, brain stimulation, and tissue regeneration. The main goal of this research is to achieve a magnetic-field control of single-molecule-scale interactions between the polar ferroelectric surfaces and charged biomolecules by designing and creating hybrid magnetic-ferroelectric nanostructures. Such hybrid nanostructures integrate ferroelectric nanomaterials, a class of nanomaterials possessing permanent and controllable electric dipoles, with magnetic materials. To date, the ferroelectric-biomolecule interactions remain largely unexplored at the single-molecule scale. A team with complementary expertise will perform closed-loop research activities including (1) computational design of the hybrid nanostructures for down-selecting their size and geometry; (2) computation-guided nanostructure fabrication; and (3) nanoscale characterization of both the surface polarization and ferroelectric-biomolecule bonding strength to provide a feedback to computation. This research will advance the understanding of the nanoscale electrostatic interactions between inorganic polar nanomaterials and organic biomolecules and will benefit society by enabling the rational design of hybrid magnetic-ferroelectric nanostructures for addressing important societal needs in medical diagnosis and treatment. The project provides excellent interdisciplinary education and training opportunities for all students and involves the students in a high-school outreach program. The goal of the outreach program is to provide unique professional development experiences for high-school science teachers, notably those from rural school districts and underrepresented groups. The outreach activities include recruiting teachers to perform project-related research in the PIs’ labs and organizing a two-day workshop “Nano Connections”. This workshop aims to introduce the participants to the advanced research topics and applications of nanomaterials and nanotechnology and develop plans for related classroom activities. The PIs will collaborate with Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers on teacher recruitment, program assessment, and post-program communication to facilitate the implementation of classroom activities. Successful demonstrations will be presented by the teachers at education conferences and adapted by the PIs for other university-wide outreach events.   &lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
