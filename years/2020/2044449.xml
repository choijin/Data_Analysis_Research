<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by creating technology-based tools that help undergraduate students and new engineers learn to integrate automated systems. Automated system integration involves designing and building systems to automate industrial processes in areas such as manufacturing, agriculture, energy, and transportation. For example, to build a robotic welding system, engineers need to integrate components such as a robot, conveyor, fixture, sensors, and actuators for loading and unloading parts. Learning to integrate components and devices to form an automated system can take many years. To maintain the nation’s economic competitiveness in an increasingly automated world, the U.S. needs many more engineers and technicians with system integration skills. This project will make it possible for students and new engineers to access instructional support as they need it, thus potentially shortening the time needed to develop system integration expertise and better preparing students for success in industrial automation-related careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create and evaluate an integrated, adaptive, and web-based problem-solving environment (I-PSE) to alleviate challenges in learning about automated system integration, enhance students’ learning experience, and generate knowledge to bridge the gaps in problem-solving environment and intelligent tutoring system design and implementation. The I-PSE will integrate three modules: (1) an intelligent tutoring system, (2) virtual/remote labs, and (3) interactive simulations. These modules will be inter-connected and designed to support one another to increase user interaction and engagement. During I-PSE development and testing, data will be collected for formative and summative evaluation.  Analysis of these data will also generate new knowledge about: how learners acquire system integration problem solving skills;  when and how much just-in-time instructional support should be provided to enable learning to occur; and how to accommodate individual differences in using tools and performing system integration tasks such as interfacing. I-PSE will be implemented and evaluated in automation, robotics, and mechatronics-related undergraduate courses at Texas A&amp;M University and at colleges and universities with a high enrollment of students from groups that are not yet equitably represented in STEM.  As a result, the I-PSE has the potential to directly impact the learning of at least 500 students. The ability to rapidly design or reconfigure automated systems to accommodate change is critical to maintaining our national economic competitiveness and security. To the extent that this effort can improve the quantity and quality of engineers, open doors for those who might need more time to master such complex material, and increase awareness of the importance of automated manufacturing systems, this project can benefit our entire society. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
