<AbstractNarration>In the “second quantum revolution,” quantum mechanics is applied to information theory and information technology. The State of Nebraska is participating in the second quantum revolution by launching an interdisciplinary, interdepartmental, and multi-campus research and education cluster on Emergent Quantum Materials and Technologies (EQUATE) to increase jurisdictional competitiveness in the  area of quantum science and technologies. The project focuses on research and workforce development to advance knowledge on topics related to quantum materials, technologies, and computation.  Quantum materials are a new class of materials that exhibit quantum phenomena at macroscopic length scales and are expected to advance the technological landscape through the advent of quantum technologies.  These new technologies will revolutionize fields such as information technology, medical technology, and cryptography, with impact on security areas such as defense and banking.  EQUATE converges for the first-time the complementary quantum science and technology expertise of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, the University of Nebraska at Omaha, the University of Nebraska at Kearney, and Creighton University, in partnership with Nebraska’s community and tribal colleges, to open up unique opportunities for Nebraska.  EQUATE consolidates the quantum science and technology expertise of 20 faculty researchers across the four Nebraska research institutions, establishing collaboration and feedback between theory and experiment to guide discoveries and expedite the findings of new emergent quantum materials and phenomena.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nebraska’s history of cutting-edge nanomaterials research has positioned the EQUATE project not only to be at the forefront of quantum materials research and education, but also to actively shape directions to help secure the future economic well-being of the State of Nebraska and the nation. EQUATE’s  main research goal is to bring Nebraska to the forefront of scientific discoveries and innovation in the design, synthesis, growth, and use of materials and hybrid systems with large-scale quantum properties for applications in sensing, metrology, communication, and information processing.  EQUATE is divided into three focused research groups (FRGs). FRG 1 will explore the emergent phenomena driven by the complex interplay between correlation, topology, and spin-orbit coupling in a variety of quantum and topological materials. FRG 2 will address current limitations impeding quantum technology by exploring solid-state spin qubits for quantum sensing and metrology, and photons for ultrafast, compact, and low-power quantum communication nanophotonic devices. FRG 3 will utilize Bose Einstein condensates for the implementation of quantum emulation and quantum computation, which have applications in fundamental problems of strongly-correlated, many-body physics and can potentially allow quantum computation above the ultra-low temperature regime that limits current platforms.  The three FRGs complement each other by combining fundamental science, applications, and computational activities.  These are necessary to advance quantum science knowledge and technologies in the jurisdiction.  The project also  introduces quantum science topics and concepts to various levels of participants, from K-12 students and their teachers to university faculty, to train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers across participating institutions and throughout Nebraska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
