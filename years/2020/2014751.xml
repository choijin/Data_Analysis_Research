<AbstractNarration>This award will support approximately 25 students to attend 2020 International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) to be located in San Diego, CA, USA from February 22 - 26, 2020. HPCA is widely recognized as one of the top-tier conferences in the field of Computer Architecture and has attendees from academia, both students and faculty, and from the industry. Students who attend the conference will be exposed to intellectually stimulating research by attending the many talks, panels, keynotes, and poster presentations at the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students receiving travel grants through this award will learn the importance of good communication skills as well as learn about what it takes to conduct high quality research, through interactions with speakers, faculty, and peer student groups. The award also seeks to enhance the diversity of the attendees, thus maintain a balance between underrepresented and other groups among the participants supported from the grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ ACCOMPLISHMENTS  The International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2020) was successfully held in San Diego between Feb 22 and 26, 2020.  We were awarded NSF Grant CCF-2014751 in the amount of $20,000.00 to partially reimburse the travel expenses of students who participated in the symposium. The Principal Investigator for the grant was Ashish Venkat, who was the Student Travel Chair for HPCA 2020, and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. The university's Office of Sponsored Programs administered the grant funds without overhead, and all the funds were directed at reimbursing student travel costs, including airfare, ground transportation, lodging, and symposium registration fees.  The symposium is widely recognized as one of the top-tier conferences in the field of Computer Architecture.  It has traditionally had high rates of student attendance and participation. Students who attend HPCA have unique opportunities to meet with industry leaders and interactwith peers from around the world. The students who participate by presenting papers or by givingposter sessions can discuss their research in depth with experts and make important contacts that will help further their research or aid in seeking employment.  All the students supported by this grant attended U.S. universities when they applied, and they flew on U.S.-flagged carriers. Each student submitted a cover letter stating their reason for attending one of the symposia, a resume, a description of their research interests, and a letter from their advisor confirming their eligibility and recommending them to attend the symposium.  The selection process by the symposium's student selection committee considered each applicant?s level of participation (paper author and presenter, poster session, or organizer), how closely the student's research interests matched areas covered by the respective symposium, and the advisor's endorsement of the student's potential for research.     IMPACT  At the symposium, students attended workshops and talks given by both industry and academia. Many of the presenters were students, and students also participated in poster sessions. There were numerous informal meetings during breaks.  The full program may be found at: https://www.hpca-conf.org/2020/main-program/.  The symposium encouraged women and underrepresented minorities to attend and thereby be eligible for travel support by this grant.  In making decisions, the student selection committee prioritized non-traditional and underrepresented applicants, such as women, international applicants, undergraduate students, and even high school students who demonstrated significant interest in attending the symposium.  Student were required to turn in a report of their experience post attending the conference.  Their opinions were overwhelmingly positive and reported that they gained valuable insights and contacts to further their research.  They were also highly appreciative that the NSF helped to enable them to attend.       Last Modified: 06/17/2021       Submitted by: Ashish Venkat]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
