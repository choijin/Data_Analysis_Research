<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is pivoted around the emerging whole slide imaging market segment in digital pathology. The digital pathology market is predicted to reach over $800 million by 2025. The motivation of this project stems from the gigabyte size of whole slide images (WSIs), which are digital images of glass slides produced at near optical resolution. With rapid increase in the number of WSIs produced by hospitals and pathology labs, the storage and management of WSIs has become an urgent problem to tackle for next-generation image analytics. The commercial viability of the project can significantly impact researchers, medical professionals, software developers, and IT staff who wish to manage large number of WSIs using modern cluster computing and big data techniques. Thus, next-generation image analytics (e.g., using deep learning) for automatic detection and analysis of cellular and morphological features in human tissues can be performed faster on large numbers of WSIs. The potential societal benefit of the project includes enabling improved diagnosis of diseases by pathologists using next-generation image analytics and the creation of a tech startup leading to new jobs. This project will provide training to two Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on a software technology that aims to solve the fundamental problem of scalable storage of WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles using a commodity cluster and big data techniques. The value proposition of the technology is efficient and cost-effective storage of large-scale WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles to enable next-generation image analytics for human disease diagnosis. The technology encompasses intelligent data partitioning using space-filling curves, in-memory data structures, and effective organization of tiles to enable fast retrieval of tiles during image analysis. It employs space-efficient storage formats to maximize storage efficiency. On an average, it required a few seconds to retrieve a single tile on 80 WSIs using a 16-node cluster. Therefore, we believe next-generation image analytics on WSIs (e.g., using deep learning) can run faster on large number of WSIs, which can consume terabytes of storage, through faster access of image tiles. As the technology relies on commodity hardware and open source software, it is cost-effective and can be easily deployed as a product or a service. The technology has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in WSI storage and management using a big data approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The team had developed a technology that can store and manage large number of digital slides of human tissues. These slides are very large in size and hence require a big data approach to manage them. The team explored if their technology can be commercialized as digital pathology solutions are being adopted in clinical practice.   Intellectual Merit:  - The team spoke to 110+ potential customers who directly or indirectly are impacted by the emerging market of digital pathology. The interviewees ranged from C-level executives, to clinicians, to residents and fellows, to sales and marketing people in the area of pathology. The team developed a business canvas model for the technology by clearly articulating the value propositions, customer segments, customer relations, revenue streams, and others. They learned that there was less commercial interest in storage and management of these digital slides today. However, there appears to be more interest in using AI for diagnostic purposes.  - The technology was further developed to improve its processing capability.  - The team went through a rigorous I-Corps training program and learned how to move technology from the lab to the marketplace.     Broader Impact:  - A total of three PhD students were trained; two of them were from underrepresented groups in STEM.  - The technology was presented at an international conference in 2020.
