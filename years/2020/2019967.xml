<AbstractNarration>This project develops image analysis algorithms and systems to process microscopy images that record the proliferation history of biological specimens and evaluate their behaviors that respond to different culturing conditions, therefore, deciphering complex biological processes and accelerating the advance of biological discovery. The research combines techniques of physical optics, computer vision and crowdsourcing to bring a breakthrough to microscopy imaging and microscopy image analysis. The developments of such technologies transform the image-based biology research from subjective to a rigorous, quantitative, and efficient manner. The research team also seeks to promote interdisciplinary collaboration between biological imaging and computer vision, integrate the research outcomes into education activities, and disseminate the project to a wide audience via web, K-12 group, conferences and industry collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous microscopy image analysis methods do not consider the particular image formation process and treat them in the same manner as general natural images, causing many difficulties or failures in the image analysis. This project addresses the challenges in a principally different way by investigating the theoretical foundation of microscopy optics. The computational imaging models of microscopes are derived and used to restore artifact-free images and extract optics-oriented image features, which makes the automated image analysis fundamentally correct and easy. The models are further used to enhance the microscope's functionalities including calibration and virtual microscopy. A cyber-enabled research community is being established within which active learning and crowd-computing are leveraged to improve the algorithm performance and biological discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updates are available from http://web.mst.edu/~yinz/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The data explosion by recoding microscopy images over days to weeks during high throughput biological experiments makes the labor-intensive manual analysis prohibitive. To decipher complex biological processes (e.g., how chemical signals and mechanical forces alter cell movement, signal transduction, cell interaction and differentiation, etc.), biologists need rigorous, quantitative and efficient approaches and tools. The overall goal of the proposed research program is to aid this biological discovery by: (1) investigating the theoretical foundation of microscopy imaging; (2) transferring the optics-related knowledge into microscopy image analysis algorithms; and (3) implementing the algorithms into practical tools capable of analyzing microscopy images with human experts in the loop.  At the optics level: The project team investigated the fundamental cause of artifacts from the microscope optics and built a theoretical foundation for microscopy imaging optics. Computational imaging models were derived to enhance the functionality of microscope hardware such as microscopy image restoration, cell-sensitive microscopy imaging, microscopy image modality transfer, refocusing microscopy image, and super-resolution microscopy. The optics-level image processing empowers the optics-oriented microscopy image analysis algorithms.  At the algorithm level: Novel optics-related image feature transform was developed such that the optics-related features interpret specimens’ inherent physical properties more closely and, therefore, are amenable to much simpler or even straightforward microscopy image processing algorithms including cell segmentation, cell detection, and cell event analysis. Based on the acquired microscopy images, annotation-efficient deep learning, graph-based semi-supervised learning, and mining representative samples for iterative network model training, were invented for cell image analysis.  At the community level: The research team investigated how human experts and algorithms can work together to achieve the best performance on biological discovery, including deep active learning, active semi-supervised learning, debugging algorithm outputs with a recommender system and correction propagation, and multi-disciplinary collaboration.  The research team summarized and presented their research outcomes in thirty-one journal/conference papers and one book chapter, including multiple paper awards in the flagship conferences and journals. Seven PhD students have been participating in this project, and four of them graduated and joined NIH and IT companies in the past four years.
