<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to develop analytic tools to study Schrodinger operators, the main object of quantum mechanics. The theory describes how a physical system,  say a bunch of particles subject to certain forces, will change over time. This is important to  predict  the behavior of the quantum particles, such as electrons, atoms and molecules. The principal investigator  will develop some  fundamental  methods to understand  the spectra and quantum dynamical behavior of Schrodinger operators. In particular, the project focuses on the conductance properties and transport  of quasi-periodic media. The results not only provide a good explanation for some phenomena in physics and chemistry,  but may also have fruitful applications to modern engineering devices such as semiconductors. Undergraduate and graduate students will have opportunities to participate in some of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at studying several aspects in mathematics by methods of functional, harmonic and geometric analysis. Quasi-periodic Schrodinger operators describe the conductivity of electrons in a two-dimensional crystal layer subject to an external magnetic field of flux  acting perpendicular to the lattice plane. The principal investigator will investigate the spectral theory of quasi-periodic operators, including spectral transitions, structure of eigenfunctions in the pure point spectrum regime, and quantum dynamics of spectral measures in the singular continuous spectrum regime. The principal investigator will also study the spectral theory of Laplacians on noncompact complete Riemannian manifolds.  The focus is on the existence of eigenvalues or singular continuous spectra embedded into essential spectra of Laplacians on asymptotically flat and on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, as characterized by the radial curvature. The goal is to better understand relations between geometric quantities and properties of eigensolutions. Lastly the principal investigator plan to study the independence of  the time-frequency translates  of various classes of functions,  which is stated as HRT conjecture.  The priority is to prove the HRT conjecture for  special configurations and HRT conjecture for exponentially decaying functions.</AbstractNarration>

With a    unique continuation result for discrete Laplacians,the PI showed  that    the discrete periodic Schrodinger  operators do not have any embedded eigenvalues  under    small perturbations of the potential. The PI provided  the  quantitative inductive estimates for Green's functions  of Toeplitz  matrices  with (sub)exponentially decaying off diagonal entries  in  any dimensions.  As  an application,  the PI established  explicit   bounds for the large deviation theorem  of  non-self-adjoint     Toeplitz operators.   Broader impacts: The PI   co-mentored  a graduate student and  mentored  a   group of   undergraduate students  on an undergraduate research project.  The PI started  an ongoing reading seminar targeting  graduate students and postdoctoral  scholars   at TAMU in the  spring  of 2020.  The PI  brought three   new ongoing proof-based math  events  to the TAMU area and  delivered  a series of lectures to   the school kids since Fall 2019.
