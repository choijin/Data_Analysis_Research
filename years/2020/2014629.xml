<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide critical development of a rapid diagnostic test capable of delivering the antibiotic resistance profile of a sample collected from patients suspected of suffering from urinary tract infections (UTIs). In the US there are approximately 8 million UTIs, and an increasing number of are caused by drug-resistant bacteria that significantly complicate the treatment of these infections. In general, patients suffering from a drug resistant UTI take longer to receive appropriate treatment, resulting in a greater risk of disease progression and onset of secondary comorbidities.  Diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify drug-resistant UTIs will have a strong and positive impact on the treatment of these infections. The proposed work aims to optimize and expand the diagnostic capacity of a first-generation diagnostic assay to create a fully comprehensive test that can detect a drug-resistant UTI in minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a dual-enzyme trigger-enabled cascade technology (DETECT), developed to detect low-abundant beta-lactamases produced by uropathogens to hydrolyze beta-lactamase antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. The presence of beta-lactamase-producing uropathogens can greatly complicate clinical decision-making because these pathogens are regularly resistant to the first-line antibiotics considered for treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). DETECT, applied as a diagnostic system, holds the potential to significantly improve the care of UTIs because it enables rapid identification of beta-lactamase-producing uropathogens directly from urine samples. The clinical feasibility of the technology has been demonstrated previously using clinical urine samples, first targeting a subset of beta-lactamases known as CTX-Ms. The proposed work aims to tune and optimize the first-generation system to offer a comprehensive diagnostic test that can accurately identify all of the clinically important beta-lactamases. This technology provides a simple, low-tech, and cost-effective way to inform patient treatment without the need of processing, urine sedimentation or centrifugation, or sophisticated instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
