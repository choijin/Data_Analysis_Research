<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in creation of a new aluminum parts manufacturing process. Aluminum is used extensively in many industries and can used in environmentally friendly applications.   The proposed technology combines next-generation laminated object manufacturing (LOM) with a novel metallic bonding process and software advancements to create solid aluminum parts ten times faster than current additive technologies.  This process can produce parts faster and at a lower cost compared to existing solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project addresses aluminum oxidation for manufacturing applications in which the oxide layer between foils must be disrupted. The team will explore multiple bonding techniques to minimize manufacturing defects while maintaining consistency of thermomechanical properties. The project's three principal goals are: 1) establish mechanical testing and optical inspection methods, 2) develop and optimize cutting and bonding processes, and 3) create a sample part to demonstrate technical feasibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
