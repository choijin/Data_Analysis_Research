<AbstractNarration>This award supports a diverse group of approximately 25 dissertation-stage students at U.S. institutions to participate in an international doctoral consortium with distinguished research faculty. The Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) doctoral consortium at the 2020 Academy of Management (AoM) convention will consist of one and a half days of talks and interactions among OCIS students and researchers. The doctoral consortium provides students with feedback on their work from other students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own dissertation research proposals. Additionally, because of the diversity of the business sub-disciplines and communities involved in the AoM conference, the consortium will allow students to establish research connections beyond their own disciplines. Consequently, participation will allow students to develop a better understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their participation in future interdisciplinary research and their progress toward becoming professional researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OCIS division at the annual AoM meeting provides a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practical issues related to the use and impact of information and communication technologies in organizations and society. This project provides a forum for doctoral students to exchange insights and receive feedback and guidance in order to enhance the quality of their dissertation research. It also facilitates the establishment of new research collaborations and professional networks and develops a greater awareness of ongoing cutting-edge research in the field of organizational communication and information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Final Report     Our goals were as follows:  1. build a diverse cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of diverse  colleagues spread out across the world;  2. guide the work of the new researchers by having the experts in the research field (i.e. mentors)  give advice;  3. provide encouragement and support for the selection of OCIS (Organizational Communication and Information Systems) research topics;  4. make it possible for promising new entrants (i.e., PhD students) to the field to attend their research  conference;  5. illustrate the interrelationship and diversity of OCIS research;  6. make the new entrants’ experience at the AOM (Academy of Management) conference an enjoyable and rewarding experience, encouraging them to return and submit papers, panels, demonstrations, posters, etc. to the conference.  7. as we learned that the conference would be run online, we aimed to achieve all the above goals using online platforms (i.e., Zoom) in creative and interactive ways.  We achieved all the above goals and more.     Significant Results  We held the OCIS Doctoral Consortium (DC, or workshop) at the Academy of Management Annual Meeting (online) on Friday, August 7, 2020 from 1pm to 5:pm Eastern time. We admitted a total of 28 doctoral students and invited 10 faculty mentors (including the consortium chair/organizer).  The breakdown of the online meeting unfolded as follows:     -        Part 1 (1-2pm): Introduction (all mentors); after this each student presented one slide with name, affiliation, research focus and one interesting fact about her/himself. The DC chair collected the slides in advance and supported the presentations. At the end of the student presentations each mentor briefly commented on them. All mentors were given all the presentation ahead of the workshop.  -        Part 2 (2-2:45pm): We created zoom breakout rooms to discuss dissertations. Each breakout room included three/four students and one mentor. Mentors received the students’ dissertation summary ahead of the workshop. Students were required to read the summaries of other students’ dissertations at the same table, ahead of the workshop.  -        Part 3 (3-4:30pm): after a short break, we created three zoom breakout rooms that we called "thematic", focusing each on one of the following topic: a) career/job market; b) life-work balance; c) ethics and academia. 2-3 faculty led each virtual room, while students rotated every 25 minutes.  -        Part 4 (4:30-5pm): concluding part: mentors summarized the workshop’s takeaways. During this final session, students were encouraged to attend key events of the forthcoming conference (we purposely hold the DC one day before the official start of the conference, to ensure that students can be mentored (also) on how to benefit in full from attending the conference).   As per what we did in the past, in the months following the DC (fall) we run an internal evaluation process (satisfaction survey to students). The evaluation of the 2020 DC showed that participants were highly satisfied with the event, with average agreement (out of 5, where 5 = strongly agree and 1 = strongly disagree) ranging from 4.06 to 4.24 on the following statements that were specifically customized with respect to the online nature of the DC: the round table discussions on the dissertation topics were helpful; the thematic roundtables (job market, life-work balance and ethics and academia) were helpful to learn more about academic life (one question for roundtable); they will recommend the OCIS DC to other students.  These ratings are in line with evaluations of the OCIS Doctoral Consortium in prior years.       Last Modified: 05/01/2021       Submitted by: Marco Marabelli]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
