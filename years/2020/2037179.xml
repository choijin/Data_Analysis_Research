<AbstractNarration>The COVID-19 epidemic has been a tremendous disruption to the education of U.S. students and their families, and early evidence suggests that this disruption has been unequally felt across households by income and race/ethnicity. While other ongoing data collection efforts focus on understanding this disruption from the perspective of students or educators, less is known about the impact of COVID-19 on children’s prek-12 educational experiences as reported by their parents, especially in STEM subjects. This study aims to understand parents’ perspectives on the educational impacts of COVID-19 by leveraging a nationally representative, longitudinal study, the Understanding America Study (UAS). The study will track educational experiences during the summer of 2020 and into the 2020-21 school year and analyze outcomes overall and for key demographic groups of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since March of 2020, the UAS has been tracking the educational impacts of COVID-19 for a nationally representative sample of approximately 1,500 households with preK-12 children. Early results focused on quantifying the digital divide and documenting the receipt of important educational services--like free meals and special education services--after COVID-19 began. This project will support targeted administration of UAS questions to parents about students’ learning experiences and engagement, overall and in STEM subjects, data analysis, and dissemination of results to key stakeholder groups. Findings will be reported overall and across key demographic groups including ethnicity, disability, urbanicity, and socioeconomic status. The grant will also support targeted research briefs addressing pressing policy questions aimed at supporting intervention strategies in states, districts, and schools moving forward. Widespread dissemination will take place through existing networks and in collaboration with other research projects focused on understanding the COVID-19 crisis. All cross-sectional and longitudinal UAS data files will be publicly available shortly after conclusion of administration so that other researchers can explore the correlates of, and outcomes associated with, COVID-19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the DRK-12 program in the Division of Research on Learning. The Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through the research and development of new innovations and approaches. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for the projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The UAS is a longitudinal, national probability-based panel of approximately 9,000 U.S. residents, collecting information at multiple time points each year on economic, attitudinal, health, political, and other measures.&nbsp;Of the full sample, approximately 1,450 households include at least one child in grades K-12. Between April and October 2020, funded by NSF RAPID Grant No. 2037179 and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, our research team administered five rounds of questions to parents asking about COVID-19&rsquo;s effects on children&rsquo;s K-12 educational experiences.&nbsp;</p> <p>In April 2020 (Wave 1), we first quantified the digital divide at the onset of COVID-19, finding a 35-percentage point income gap in the percent of households with children who had access to a computer and internet for students to work. We also saw racial/ethnic gaps in parents&rsquo; concerns about their students&rsquo; readiness for next year.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Waves 2 (April-May 2020) and 3 (May-June 2020) we found while most parents reported their children were receiving school work in April-May, lower proportions were interacting with teachers online or receiving feedback, with stark income differential. While 72 percent of the highest income households reported their child received feedback from their teacher, 58 percent of the lowest income group reported the same.</p> <p>By May, the proportions of parents reporting their children had received critical school services in February had dropped dramatically under school closures. Just over half (54 percent) of children receiving meals when schools were open continued to receive meal service after closures. Sixty-one percent of parents who reported their child previously received special education services continued to.&nbsp;</p> <p>In summer 2020 (Wave 4), we added questions probing parent attitudes toward school responses, revealing stark differences by race and income in preferences for children&rsquo;s attendance mode.</p> <p>In fall 2020 (Wave 5), we documented disparities in enrollment mode (i.e., in-person, hybrid, fully-remote) by subgroups (Figure 1), and explored parents&rsquo; perceptions of their children&rsquo;s needs. Mode of attendance strongly drove educational experiences, with parents of in-person students reporting educational quality and student mental health had mostly rebounded back to pre-pandemic levels while parents of remote students did not.&nbsp;</p> <p>We learned about unmet learner needs, including that 40% of remote-learning students in the lowest income households had insufficient internet access. We also learned that parents were highly&mdash;and increasingly&mdash;supportive of mask mandates in schools, and of canceling 2021 standardized tests. These results informed policy responses, particularly by substantiating the intensity of the need for children to have the option to return to school in person, and specifying high-priority remote learner needs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Starting in November 2020, we began asking parents every two weeks: a) how their child was enrolled (i.e., fully in-person, fully remote, or a hybrid mix), b) how they wanted their child to be enrolled, c) proportion of the child&rsquo;s school attending in person, and d) about school mitigation practices like student and teacher mask-wearing. We switched to monthly administration of these questions from mid-February through June 2021. Child enrollment mode and parents&rsquo; enrollment preferences have varied considerably by parent race and family income.&nbsp;</p> <p>We have disseminated results to education and mainstream audiences through publications our team has authored, including&nbsp;<em>74million, Brookings, Conversation, CRPE Evidence Project, Education Next, FutureEd, Hetchinger, USC Evidence Base</em>, and presentations (e.g., to foundations, NSF audiences).
