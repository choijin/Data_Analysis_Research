<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Associate Professor John T. Giblin, Jr. at Kenyon College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Universe is a complex and constantly evolving system.  Buried in this system are clues about physics at extreme conditions such as temperatures and energies beyond the capacity of terrestrial experiments.   Our current understanding of the Universe includes a number of mysteries:  dark matter, dark energy, and the physics that describes the very early Universe.  Carefully studying this system is therefore one of the most promising avenues we have for extending our understanding of the nature of matter and energy.  Professor Giblin and his students will study several foundational questions in fundamental physics.   If there was a period of rapid expansion in the very early Universe, how do we describe it and how did it end?  How should dark matter be described?   Are there any hints that there are more particles in the Universe than we currently know?   Professor Giblin will develop new, cutting-edge, computational tools that will permit the study of the evolution of the Universe with extreme accuracy.  Six undergraduates will also participate in this work.  This work is therefore in the national interest as it builds scientifically literate and numerically skillful human resources and deepens our understanding of basic science.  Additionally, this research project includes outreach to high-school classrooms, thereby bringing new tools and new scientific topics to high-school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, Professor Giblin will study realistic models of inflation and the observational signatures of nonlinear processes at the end of inflation in order to test and rule out inflationary scenarios through observations of the cosmic microwave background.  He will also study the implications of measurements of gravitational-wave backgrounds and intergalactic magnetic fields.  Professor Giblin will also study the Schrodinger description of non-relativistic dark matter as a possible description of ultra-light axion-like particles.  Additionally, he will probe whether the introduction of Early Dark Energy --- extra degrees of freedom from beyond-the-standard-model physics --- can ease the so-called "Hubble-Lemaitre" tension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
