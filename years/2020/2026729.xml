<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a painless and convenient solution to diabetes patients to help them self-manage the disease. It will also help pre-diabetic people determine blood glucose levels at an earlier stage. This project will explore translation mechanisms for a novel sensor that can be measured with commercial electronic products, such as a smartphone camera. The system also uses artificial intelligence to help interpret the results. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project provides an artificial intelligence-based plasmonic sensing system for gas sensing and biosensing purposes. The project uses specially designed and fabricated nanostructures with a plasmonic sensor generating an optical signal at visible wavelengths. The resulting signal can be measured by a CMOS camera. A neural network-based data analyzing system is used to study the images and thus classify and quantify the target analytes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
