<AbstractNarration>Many Antarctic glaciers are discharging ice to the sea and contributing to global sea-level rise at an accelerating pace. However, future rates of ice discharged remain uncertain in part because of incomplete characterization of processes occurring at the ice-bed interface. In particular, ice-bed interface processes depend sensitively on the subglacial effective pressure, N (overburden pressure minus basal water pressure), but limited knowledge of how N changes in space and time have inhibited the realistic incorporation of N into ice discharge estimates. N has only been directly measured in a few locations. Marine-acoustics researchers have proposed a seismic-wave propagation theory that relates N of water-saturated granular sediments, similar to the subglacial tills that are prevalent under Antarctic glaciers, to the seismic-wave reflection characteristics. This project will conduct novel lab experiments to constrain and test the theory, then investigate how N varies in space and time in Antarctica from the existing active-seismic data with the insights gained from the experiments. The outcome of this work could be applied to a large volume of existing and future active-seismic data, allowing for the possibility of increased mapping of N both in space and time. This could in turn lead to improved understanding of glacier and ice-sheet dynamics and ultimately reduce uncertainties in future projections of sea-level rise originating from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, or any other ice mass underlain by till.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Subglacial effective pressure, N, is one of the key parameters required for estimating glacial motion but is notoriously hard to measure. Common techniques for estimating N have been the labor-intensive practice of measuring it directly from boreholes and connected moulins or inferring it from surface-velocity inversions. This project will test, calibrate and implement the theory of seismic-wave propagation that relates N of water-saturated granular sediments, developed for marine sediments, to subglacial conditions. A large-diameter ring-shear device will be used to shear temperate ice over a range of known till types at controlled N values, simulating subglacial slip over a deformable bed. The ring shear will be outfitted with an acoustic signal generating/sensing system that will allow continuous measurements of the seismic reflection amplitude of the ice-bed interface. These data will be used to relate reflection amplitudes directly to N in a situation where porosity and grain-size distribution can be measured. Till types will include end member fine- and course-grained tills, as well as a synthetic till generated to replicate Whillans Ice Stream. Even if N is found to only have a second-order effect on reflection amplitude and that porosity is the dominant factor, the experiments will still provide a much-needed constraint for interpreting existing active-seismic data in terms of porosity. The findings from the experiments will be used to reanalyze existing active-seismic data to investigate how N varies with space and time. Specifically, this work will reanalyze seismic data collected on Whillans, Kamb and Rutford Ice Streams where grain-size distributions are known from subglacial sediment-core samples. The results of this project could provide a novel technique to greatly increase our understanding of subglacial hydrology and dependency of ice flow on subglacial effective pressure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
