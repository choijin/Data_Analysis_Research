<AbstractNarration>This project will develop an electronic textbook (E-book) to support vacuum technology education.  Vacuum technology is a critical, enabling technology for many industries, with semiconductor manufacturing being one of the largest.  According to the 2019 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association, the global semiconductor industry is a key growth sector in the global economy, with the US semiconductor industry accounting for almost half the global market share in 2018.  US-based industry semiconductor sales exceeded $200 billion in 2018 and the industry employs over 241,000 direct jobs.  Currently, a cohort of community colleges prepares manufacturing technicians for the US semiconductor industry.  Preparing technicians for this industry is a challenge for community colleges especially in complex technologies such as vacuum technology.  One of the challenges is finding technician-level textbooks and equipping learning environments that facilitate the development of industry-needed skills.  The E-book is expected to fill this need through its text and its associated animations, tutorials, video demonstrations, and interactive assessments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will convert the first four chapters of the text "Introduction to Vacuum Technology" by David M. Hata into a modern electronic book. This format will increase access to vacuum technology instructional resources for both students and incumbent workers.  In addition, the project will develop a laboratory guide to help community college instructors develop hands-on learning environments for their students.  This laboratory guide will present options for implementing vacuum training systems, along with video demonstrations of equipment set-up and operation for laboratory experiments.  All materials will be classroom-tested at Erie Community College, Normandale Community College, and other partner colleges.  Erie Community College and Normandale Community College will license the e-book and associated resources through a Creative Commons license, and disseminate it with help of The Society of Vacuum Coaters, a professional society, and Lesker, Inc., a vacuum equipment supplier. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
