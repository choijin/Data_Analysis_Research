<AbstractNarration>The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce errors and improve accuracy, standardization, agreement, and reporting in evaluation of COVID-19 lung disease severity on chest computed tomography (CT) images. Chest CT procedures play a critical role in COVID-19 patients but current methods for evaluating chest CT images lack accurate, quantitative, or consistent information, leading to text-based reports that are difficult to interpret. The proposed AI-assisted COVID-19 chest CT workflow will efficiently capture the fraction of lung involvement and improve communication with clinicians by providing a standardized graphical report, key images of important findings, and structured text. The quantitative data will standardize reporting on an individual patient basis and provide data for population-level analyses, thereby offering the potential to significantly advance scientific knowledge of COVID-19 lung disease on a national level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an AI-assisted COVID-19 chest CT workflow to rapidly and objectively quantify the percentage of lung involvement, classify lung involvement using the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS), track common and uncommon COVID-19 lung findings, and automatically generate summary reports with a graph, key images, and structured text. The standard-of-care for assessing and reporting COVID-19 lung disease severity on chest CT images involves dictated text-based reports that are subjective, highly variable, inefficient to generate and interpret, prone to errors, incomplete, and qualitative with data provided in an unstandardized format. The proposed AI-assisted COVID-19 chest CT workflow will reduce interpretation errors and omissions and improve accuracy, standardization, inter-observer agreement, efficiency, and reporting in evaluation of COVID-19 disease severity and response to treatment. This project will validate the working prototype with a team of expert clinicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Our team developed a machine-learning quantitative CT biomarker to measure PSI on HRCT images to generate a PSI score. The PSI score is independent of lung opacities and is prognostic of transplant-free survival in pilot single-institution retrospective studies including patients with a wide variety of pulmonary fibroses. However, the relevance of PSI score in patients with COVID-19 infection is unknown.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate the role of PSI score in patients with prior COVID-19 infection who underwent HRCT to evaluate for pulmonary fibrosis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Methods:</strong></p> <p>A search of the radiology information system (RIS) at the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB) Department of Radiology was performed to identify adult patients with prior COVID-19 infection who were evaluated for pulmonary fibrosis via outpatient HRCT.

Each lobe was scored 0-5 in severity for a total maximal possible severity of 25. A single reader measured the PSI score on 10 slices in the right and left lungs in all patients (N=100). The visual pulmonary fibrosis score and PSI score were correlated with one another and associated with pulmonary function tests and GAP score. The scores from right and left lungs were correlated.

When evaluating the right lung in the full cohort (N=100), the visual scores in patients with prior COVID-19 infection were significantly higher vs. normal patients (median 3.5 vs. 0.0, p&lt;0.001; <strong>Figure 2</strong>).
