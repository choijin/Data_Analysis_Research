<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and in collaboration with Tom van de Goor of Agilent Technologies, Professor Dwight Stoll and his group at Gustavus Adolphus College are working to improve the capabilities of two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) - an important approach to separating the components of complex chemical mixtures as part of the process of identifying and quantifying components.  This academic/industrial collaboration seeks deeper understanding of the role of hardware interfaces in limiting the performance of current 2D-LC approaches.  The research also seeks to develop innovative interfaces that will improve the speed and other performance metrics of analyses based on 2D-LC, while decreasing their cost. These innovations may be useful to scientists and engineers facing the need for detailed analysis of complex materials such as new protein-based drugs, chemical products based on renewable starting materials, and biofluids (including blood and urine) for which better analyses can enhance the understanding and diagnosis of disease.  Dr. Stoll involves students at the high school and undergraduate levels in this cutting-edge research to prepare them to become the workforce of the future.  He also develops simulations to facilitate learning about liquid chromatography and the more effective use of the technique across many sectors of the U.S. economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the majority of practical 2D-LC methods, the two separations are coupled using a valve-based interface that transfers small fractions of material exiting the first column to the inlet of the second column for further separation. Despite its critical role in the effectiveness of 2D-LC separations, innovation in the area of interface technology has been sluggish. The valves in common use today are conceptually quite similar to those used for the first 2D-LC separations four decades ago, and have weaknesses that negatively impact the performance of 2D-LC with respect to reliability, ease-of-use, and separation power. In this project, the Stoll Group is evaluating several innovative interface designs that either eliminate the valve entirely, or redefine the function of the valve in ways that have the potential to change the interface from a point of weakness to a point of strength of 2D-LC technology. As part of these studies they are evaluating the impact of different interface designs on other aspects of the system, such as the lifetime of second dimension columns. Finally, they are building simulation tools that recognize the unique features of the new interfaces to support facile development of new 2D-LC methods that are suitable for addressing contemporary separation challenges in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and life sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
