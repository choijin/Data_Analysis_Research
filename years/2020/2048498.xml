<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps Hubs project is the development of a highly collaborative network of university partners and affiliates serving the New York region by providing innovation infrastructure, training, and research for the National Innovation Network (NIN) entrepreneurship ecosystem.  Led by City University of New York (CUNY), Columbia University, and New York University along with six other affiliated schools, the New York Region I-Corps Hub creates and maintains a culture of innovation dedicated to deep technology entrepreneurial educational training and acceleration programs.  New York’s vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem evolved from strategic investments in innovation and entrepreneurship by academic, governmental, and private entities in the region.  This technological advancement has been, and continues to be, the basis for long-term sustainable economic growth.  The New York Region Hub will leverage its strong, effective network infrastructure to nurture and produce opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship across the region.  The Hub will maintain and build upon its leadership and accomplishments, especially with virtual programming and training, to continue to strengthen the NIN.  The New York Region Hub will enhance national innovation capacity by extending the reach and benefits of the NSF I-Corps program to diverse communities of innovators in fundamental science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Hubs project is based on the development of a structured portal for accessing the New York region’s unique combination of world-class universities, venture capital investment resources, and one of the nation’s fastest growing deep technology startup cultures.  The New York region I-Corps Hub has one of the most diverse and experienced teaching teams within the National Innovation Network, comprising entrepreneurial innovators from startups, network schools, business development units, and New York City’s investment community.  The New York Hub is poised to leverage its leadership in the development and utilization of internet-based training tools and approaches.  It will continue to lead the nation in supporting and producing affiliates who will generate inclusive deep technology I-Corps teams and expand participation at all levels to members of underrepresented groups.  The New York Region Hub will serve as a repository for technology innovation development data and outcomes.  It will expand its research conducted on entrepreneurial ecosystems and its potential to impact policy and practice at the national level, particularly on deep technology ventures.  By using its data to develop innovative, original models, the New York Region Hub will influence how entrepreneurship is encouraged and brought to fruition throughout the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
