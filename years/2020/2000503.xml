<AbstractNarration>There has been a considerable amount of study about thunderstorm complexes and how they intensify and sustain themselves over the continental United States.  Less research has been conducted on how those complexes interact with the cooler, more stable air of the marine atmospheric boundary layer along coastal regions.  This study will consist of numerical model simulations of thunderstorms as they move offshore.  The importance of this research lies in the fact that these types of thunderstorm complexes contribute to a significant portion of severe weather reports in heavily populated coastal areas of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States.  The main outcome of this project will be an understanding of the factors that lead to the decay of the thunderstorms near the shoreline, survival of the storms until just offshore, or whether the systems can sustain themselves well out into the ocean.  The lead researcher will interact with the National Weather Service and other government and private entities to ensure that the knowledge is transferred to decision-makers.  This project will also contribute to the future scientific workforce through the training of a graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher plans to improve understanding and prediction of evolving quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS) as they move offshore from inland regions and interact with the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) over coastal waters.  The project will systematically study the storm scale physical processes through idealized numerical modeling using a cloud resolving model.  The magnitude and depth of the vertical wind shear, the strength of the diabatically generated cold pool associated with the convective storm, and the structure of the sea breeze-MABL boundary will be altered in the suite of idealized numerical sensitivity tests.  Some of the scientific questions that motivate the study include:  Is the low- or mid-level shear more influential on the evolution of the QLCS?  What is the source region of the air being ingested into the QLCS?  How do the QLCS characteristics change as the system interacts with the MABL boundary and as it moves offshore?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  During the summertime, coherent lines of thunderstorms, called squall lines, are frequently observed over many places globally, including over densely populated coastal regions. These types of storms are particularly dangerous, capable of producing heavy precipitation, flash flooding, frequent lightning, high winds, hail, and tornadoes. Forecasting the intensity, lifetime, and destructive nature of these storms as they move over coastlines, from land to sea, is notoriously challenging. The challenge arises because of the influence of coastal sea breezes on storm dynamics, and the counterintuitive storm evolution as squall lines move over the cool ocean waters. Squall lines are very sensitive to the air temperature, moisture, and wind near the surface, which are atmospheric variables that change drastically moving from inland areas to offshore. Moving from warm inland areas to cooler ocean environments is often thought to cause storms to weaken, since they lose their supply of energy from the warm air; however, this weakening only occurs for a fraction of storms. Understanding why and how squall lines respond to these low-level atmospheric changes is critical to issuing accurate and timely weather warnings, designed to inform coastal residents, those participating in coastal recreational and commercial activities, and coastal military operations of the impending hazards, allowing adequate time to seek protection. While results from this work can be applied to coastal squall lines globally, this research targeted storms over the U.S. Northeast and Mid-Atlantic coastal region, due to their high-impact and frequent occurrence.    From this research, critical insights have been gained into why some storms decay near or at the coastline, causing little damage to coastal communities, while others remain strong and sometimes intensify, leading to property damage and loss of life. A fundamental factor in controlling the coastal crossing outcome is the density of the low-level air over the ocean versus the density of the cool thunderstorm outflow. Counterintuitively, when the marine air is very cold and dense, and colder than the thunderstorm outflow, squall lines successfully move offshore. When the marine air is less cool, and warmer than the thunderstorm outflow, storms decay near the coast. Such differences are a consequence of the dynamic mechanism that lifts air into the storm, which also controls the source of air brought into the storm. When marine air is not as cold as the storm outflow, but still cooler than air over land, squall lines ingest this low-energy air, leading to storm weakening. When the marine air is very cold, squall lines ingest the warmer, high-energy air from above the cool marine layer, allowing storms to persist.   This work has also shown that as a squall line moves toward the sea breeze front, but before reaching the boundary, the line of storms can widen and ‘jump’ forward. The widening expands the area impacted by heavy rains and other hazards, while the ‘jump’ causes these hazards to arrive at a given location sooner than expected. Though this can occur several different ways, it is fundamentally a consequence of the overlap between changes to the atmosphere induced by the storm and changes to the atmosphere induced by the sea breeze, which leads to the formation of more storm cells.   The presence of mountains near or at the coastline can cause rain to become heavier over the mountain coastal slope, as the storm outflow and sea breeze front collide. The heaviest rain forms when the marine air is very cold compared to the storm outflow, though there is little change in rain when the storm outflow is colder than the marine air. Following the outflow-sea breeze collision, storms moving offshore over very cold marine air weaken, while storms moving over less cold marine air intensify, opposite to the storm evolution in the absence of mountains. The presence of mountains prevents the formation of the dynamic mechanism that brings warm air from above the cool marine layer into the storm, and low-energy air from within the marine layer rises into the storm causing weakening. The colder the marine air, the faster the weakening.
