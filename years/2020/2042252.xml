<AbstractNarration>Adult language learning is of primary social importance, but most research has overlooked the influences of the linguistic environment of the learner and of previous language history. Recent research suggests that there is significant variation in adult language learning outcomes. This variation likely comes not only from individual differences in cognitive skills but also from differences in previous language experience. The vast majority of research on adult language learning has focused on individuals who are learning a second language for the first time. In today's globalized society, however, the majority of people learning a new language already know or have considerable exposure to more than one language. In order to fully understand new language learning in adults and to design effective pedagogical methods, it is important to consider how cognitive abilities and previous language experience impact the learning process. This project takes a novel approach by teaching a third language to people who are already bilingual with many years of second language experience. This will enable examination of the impact of the context of learning as well as individual differences in cognitive skills.  In order to understand language learning in situations where there is cultural and linguistic diversity, the planned study will take place at a university with a large and diverse student population. The planned study also aims to benefit the student participants by providing training opportunities in language science, thereby helping to support an increase in the diversity of the scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The context in which language learning and language use occur has a range of consequences for communication and cognition. Some learning contexts are linguistically diverse, with ambient exposure to languages that may not be known or used, whereas others are more uniform, with a single majority language that dominates. Recent studies suggest that ambient language exposure may itself benefit phonetic learning. Other studies suggest that the regulation of the two languages in different contexts may produce a variety of consequences for the way in which cognitive control mechanisms are engaged. For example, bilinguals living in environments where their non-dominant language is supported may rely more on proactive control. The planned research will compare the performance of two groups of bilinguals in the US as they learn a novel language.  One group lives in a region with ambient exposure to the novel language in their environment. The other group lives in a largely monolingual English environment with little linguistic diversity. Both groups are immersed in English, their non-dominant language, although the second group is immersed in English to a greater extent. Participants will complete a series of tasks to learn morphosyntax (gender assignment) and certain phonetic distinctions in the third, novel language. The ability to engage proactive control resources and ambient exposure are hypothesized to lead to enhanced learning outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
