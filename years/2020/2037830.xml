<AbstractNarration>This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative:  National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center).  The focus of a spectrum research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum.  The need for wireless systems is exponentially growing, and future implications need to be explored. Emerging issues, opportunities and challenges for use of highly valuable spectrum and the definition of important and potential breakthrough research agendas and new technologies need to be defined to meet new challenges and achieve a safe, secure, and reliable mobile networked world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Led by the University of California, San Diego, the assembled team includes team members from the University of Oklahoma, Stanford University, the University of Wisconsin, New York University, Hughes Research Laboratory, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Keysight Technologies, Qualcomm, MIT, Lincoln Laboratory, Shared Spectrum Company, Verizon, and Google. Key areas the team will explore include science users, air traffic management, communications, radars, wide area radio frequency sensing including low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations, radio layer innovations with particular emphases on machine learning and networking around small cells, implementation aspects of 6G and THz band systems, and policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Topics covered included 1) enabling transformative use cases and services with spectrum innovation, 2) spectrum sensing and sensing-driven networking, 3) spectrum policy, 4) spectrum challenges and opportunities for weather observation, 5) global navigation and satellite systems and 6G, and 6) spectrum challenges for ultra-dense mmWave coverage.

Opening remarks were followed by lightning talks, breakout sessions, or panel discussions, followed by Q&amp;A opportunities and open discussions. More details about workshop topics, objectives, and program agendas can be found on the SII Planning Project website at https://si-planning.ucsd.edu/. Findings and Recommendations:  Several key challenges and needs in the areas of infrastructure, technology, policy, and education were identified as common threads throughout each of the six workshops. These included the following findings and recommendations:  One person?s signal is another person?s noise: Each system?s precisely engineered radiated signal is treated as stochastic noise to be mitigated against by other impacted systems. Information sharing across disparate systems can enhance performance: Disparate systems can assist each other effectively by sharing salient information about terrain, location, timing, and radiated waveform. Security and Privacy are critical: Not all systems will or should explicitly share information about their activities with unknown third parties. Untapped opportunities exist with new software and hardware tools: New tools, instruments, and methods, such as machine learning, digital twins, and networked instruments, offer opportunities for the joint development of   next generation of communication and sensing systems. Policies are needed to spur innovation: Spectrum policies and regulations need to make room for new innovators by lowering the barrier to entry. There is an education and workforce shortage: A dire shortage exists of trained professionals to address the rapidly growing and ever more complex set of issues that wireless systems are creating.   Outcomes:  Based on the findings and recommendations of the planning workshops, a collaborative team consisting of 40 individuals from 10 partner institutions (UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, NCSU, OU, UT Austin, University of Wisconsin, NYU, Stanford, USC, and University of Pennsylvania) was created to bring together expertise in the following spectrum-critical areas: (1) radio frequency sensing, (2) active and passive meteorological radars, (3) precision navigation and timing, and (4) policy and economic development.
