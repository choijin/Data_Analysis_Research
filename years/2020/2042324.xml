<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by investigating a new approach to teaching computer science (CS) that fosters inclusive and equitable practices. The structure of a typical undergraduate computer science degree program has changed little in decades. The curricula rarely include courses like CS ethics or usability that teach CS students how systems affect people and society. When such courses are included, they are largely disconnected from the rest of the CS degree. As a result, students entering the workforce tend to design software that is highly inequitable for large portions of the intended users of that software. This project will investigate a new approach to teaching CS that embeds equitable software design into computing courses throughout all four years of the undergraduate CS curriculum. The new approach does not require large changes to the curriculum, but instead integrates equity and inclusion into the CS work the students are already doing. Through the participation of three universities, over 20 faculty, and over 6000 students, this project will investigate the effectiveness, sustainability, and impact of the new approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is based on the foundations of equitable design methods. The expected results of this project will include new course materials to support transforming an existing CS curriculum to one that embeds equitable design, and professional development for faculty to foster success at embedding equitable software design into their courses. Research questions that will be investigated as part of this work will generate knowledge that will allow CS teachers to better understand the impacts of the changes on the ability of students to create high-quality software that is equitable, the impacts on the culture in computing classes and majors, and the feasibility of the approach across several different educational settings. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
