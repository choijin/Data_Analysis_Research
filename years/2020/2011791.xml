<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students to pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. LeMoyne-Owen College proposes to enhance the performance of its students in mathematics by utilizing the intelligent adaptive software (iALS) known as “ALEKS” (which stands for Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces) in its mathematics courses.  The project is in line with other efforts across the nation that aim to innovate the delivery of mathematics courses and effect improved student performance that translates to increase numbers of STEM scholars who are typically underrepresented in those fields.  It will provide insight into the impact of iALS at HBCUs.  The project targets three introductory math courses that are taken by all students at the institution.  If successful, this project will be integral to reducing the student attrition rate in math courses, and ultimately improve the numbers of STEM majors who are retained and graduate with STEM degrees.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to increase passing rates of LeMoyne-Owen College’s students who enroll in mathematics courses by utilizing technology-based, active learning math interventions.  The three objectives that will accomplish the overall goal are as follows: (1) to increase the average pass rates for the remedial math course (MATH 011) by 20% above the baseline over three years; (2) to create an engaging system to support students who enter college underprepared for college level mathematics; and (3) to increase retention rates of freshmen STEM majors in mathematics through College Algebra by 20% above the baseline over three years.  The PIs will adopt evidence-based learning pedagogy into the mathematics curriculum using ALEKS as both a placement tool and as an active learning strategy in the selected math courses. An existing computer lab will be redesigned and designated as the ALEKS lab where students can receive assistance from trained peer tutors. Faculty will have access to real-time data to monitor student progress through the ALEKS dashboard and be able to customize their class-times to address the most critical needs. Students will be able to self-pace through the enhanced, introductory math courses, and potentially complete three math courses in two semesters. Additionally, students will be provided access to the ALEKS placement tool during the summer prior to their freshman year. In sum, the project promises to positively impact students who are typically underrepresented in STEM fields, and ultimately increase the number of STEM scholars from underserved populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
