<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by broadening participation of hearing-impaired students in STEM learning, majors, and careers, specifically in biological sciences.  Many undergraduate students who are deaf or hard of hearing encounter language-related obstacles to learning biological content.  Overcoming these obstacles could support their success in biological sciences courses and majors. Increasing the biological vocabulary of American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters is a key step toward achieving this goal.  In this project, TERC and Lamar University will develop and evaluate a unique set of materials for training ASL interpreters. The cornerstone of these materials is a Signing BioScience Dictionary that includes a set of signed terms commonly found in undergraduate lecture material.  To accompany the dictionary, the project will develop summaries of core biology concepts to provide context for the terms and video examples of accurate and fluent interpretations of biology lecture material.  Finally, strategies will be developed to help instructors incorporate these materials into Lamar University’s four-year undergraduate ASL interpreter training program. This project builds on the outcomes of prior work that produced a prototype Signing BioScience Dictionary and findings about the types of teaching and learning materials that are most useful to support training ASL interpreters to communicate biology content fluently and accurately. This project has the potential to open doors to STEM knowledge, particularly in biology, for deaf and hard of hearing learners across the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has six goals: 1) Prepare a beta version of the Signing BioScience Dictionary; 2) Create summaries of core biology content needed for fluent and accurate interpretation of undergraduate biology lecture material; 3) Produce video examples of fluent interpretations of biology lecture material; 4) Evaluate the use and effectiveness of the Signing BioScience Dictionary, summaries, and videos in increasing student interpreters’ ASL vocabulary, knowledge of related content, and ability to accurately and fluently interpret undergraduate biology lecture material; 5) Design a set of instructional practices for use of the Signing BioScience Dictionary, summaries, and videos in interpreter training programs; and 6) Disseminate project deliverables. A mixed-measurement design that combines qualitative and quantitative data will be employed to evaluate how Lamar University undergraduate students in the interpreter training program use the Signing BioScience Dictionary, biology content summaries, and videos.  In addition, the research will explore the effectiveness of the Signing BioScience Dictionary, content summaries, and videos in increasing the undergraduate student interpreters’ ASL biology vocabulary and biology content knowledge, as well as their ability to interpret a typical undergraduate biology lecture accurately and clearly.  Results of these studies will inform the project team about additions and/or changes that could make the materials more effective.  The project has the potential to make biology content more accessible to undergraduates who are deaf or hard of hearing, and thus may be instrumental in supporting their pursuit of biology (or other STEM) majors and careers. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
