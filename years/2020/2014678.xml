<AbstractNarration>The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to advance the development of a highly integrated power-efficient micro-actuator technology.  All electrically powered systems with mechanical moving parts utilize actuators to convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, including robots, surgical/medical micro-devices, precision micro/nano-positioning systems, and optical systems like the Compact Camera Modules (CCM) in smartphones and tablets.  The market for electromechanical actuators embedded in compact camera modules was an estimated $2+ B in 2018.  The proposed project will advance a technology for these CCM optical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project aims to explore commercialization of arrayed cell electrostatic (ACE) actuators.  Arrangement of individual micro-scale actuator cells, resembling that of biological muscle cells, allows addition of force and displacements of a large number of cells, leading to large actuator displacements of hundreds of microns.  Submicron electrostatic transduction airgaps within the actuator cells between electrodes tens of microns tall are realized via a bulk micromachining fabrication process utilizing a sacrificial layer technique.  Submicron transduction gaps lead to large work output per actuator volume and lower operating voltage, both of which are major limiting factors for electrostatic actuators.  This project specifically focuses on micro-lens manipulators to replace conventional Voice Coil Motors (VCM) in compact camera modules for Auto-Focus (AF) and Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) functions.  The targeted actuators can lead to more compact CCMs with improved auto-focus and image stabilization performance, lower power consumption, and without the VCM heat deteriorating the image sensor performance. The technical efforts will focus on design, fabrication, and characterization of a chip-scale low-power 5-degree of freedom (DOF) micro-lens manipulator suitable for use in compact camera modules.  Comprehensive long-term reliability and durability tests will be performed on the fabricated prototypes to determine the limitations and viability of the actuators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under this Phase I STTR project Silicon DynamiX investigated the potentials of Arrayed Cell Actuators (ACE), a recently developed micromachined electromechanical actuator technology, for micro-lens manipulation in compact camera modules. Compact Camera Modules (CCM) have become an integral part of smart-phones, tablets, and other portable electronic devices and advanced features such as Auto-Focusing (AF) and vibration cancellation, also known as Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), are standard in state of the art CCMs.  AF and OIS functionalities require the micro-lens of the camera module to be physically displaced necessitating a millimeter-scale electromechanical actuator to be embedded within the camera module.  During the course of this project multi-dimensional micro-lens manipulators comprised of a number of ACE actuators integrated on the same silicon chip were successfully designed, fabricated, and characterized.  Such manipulators are capable of moving a micro-lens in X, Y, and Z directions by tens to hundreds of microsn hence performing AF and OIS in a compact camera module.     Silicon DynamiX completed an advanced extensive study on various designs for multiple ACE actuators to be embedded within a single chip to achieve 3-axis manipulation as OIS/AF actuator of a CCM.  One of the main design challenges was to eliminate the cross talk between the different integrated actuators moving the lens in different directions.  A dual-frame design with directionally selective tethers was devised to address this problem. The design is comprises of an inner frame carrying 4 actuators responsible for the horizontal movement (along X and Y axes) carried by the vertical (Z-axis) actuators fixed to the main outer frame.     Through iterations of fabrication process adjustments working 3-axis actuator chips were successfully fabricated and performance of several prototypes was characterized.  The Phase I results have been promising in terms of proving feasibility and showing the desired performance, reliability and durability for the developed actuators.  Actuators with adequate range of movement, force output, speed, and tens of millions of cycles of flawless operation have been demonstrated.
