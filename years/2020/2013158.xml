<AbstractNarration>This award will support graduate student and postdoctoral attendance at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) meeting at Babson Park, Massachusetts on July 12 - 17, 2020. The meeting focuses on Yeast Chromosome Biology and the Cell Cycle and is co-organized by Drs. Mosur Raghuraman and Soni Lacefield, at the University of Washington and Indiana University, respectively. The format of the meeting is a combination of 27 invited talks and 21 talks selected from submitted abstracts (both 25 minute duration), several poster sessions and “flash talks” from 10-15 trainees on their posters. A keynote lecture by Virginia Zakian (Princeton University) will begin the meeting. There are also two dedicated 1-hour sessions for trainees to interact with leading experts and three separate poster sessions held in the evenings. A career-workshop will also be held for trainees. Nearly 50% of the invited talks are by women and special emphasis has been placed on including graduate students, postdocs and those underrepresented in science in every aspect of the meeting. This meeting also affords many opportunities (both formal and informal) for sharing recent research findings and exploring collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a premier meeting on yeast chromosome biology and cell cycle regulation, now in its 30th year. Recent advances in chromosome biology, DNA replication, repair and recombination, telomere maintenance, and mitotic and meiotic processes will be highlighted in this conference, which will bring together diverse scientists from across the country and internationally. The session topics include: Chromatin and Nuclear Organization, Cell Cycle Regulation, Genome Stability and Repair, DNA Replication, Telomeres and End Maintenance, Kinetochores and Spindles, Mitosis and lastly, Meiosis and Recombination. The conference primarily highlights unpublished research findings and provides many experiences for young researchers to learn about the field and devise future avenues for research. The meeting will encourage career development of a new generation of researchers, including those who are underrepresented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
