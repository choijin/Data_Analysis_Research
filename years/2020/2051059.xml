<AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site "Lasers and Optics" at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln (UNL) offers research in physics, chemistry, and engineering, with a specific focus on the use of lasers and optics. Each summer in the period of 2021–2023, eight REU participants will have a 10-week, first-hand research experience. Students will conduct research under the direct supervision of faculty who are established experts in their fields. Recruitment focuses on underrepresented groups in physics, chemistry, and engineering and on academic institutions with insufficient scientific research resources. In addition to research in state-of-the-art laboratories, the program includes student professional development and community outreach. Unique to this site, suitable student projects will be selected to create virtual or augmented reality presentations for a general audience to stimulate public engagement with science and technology. The first-hand research experience the REU students will have gained will prepare them for scientific careers and strengthen the nation's competitiveness on a global scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a specific focus on research supported by lasers and optics, this REU Site offers research in physics, chemistry, and engineering. A team of eight scientific experts will mentor students in a broad range of topical research projects. This includes cutting-edge research with laser-driven multi-fiber nanotip electron sources, imaging of femtosecond molecular dynamics, generation of femtosecond X-ray pulses, spectroscopy, metamaterials for photonic and optical applications, the propagation of laser pulses in liquids, programmable spatial light modulation, and femtosecond laser surface processing. Students will also create virtual and augmented reality projects. This prepares them for a future in which these novel tools will be used to do research and present data and thus contribute to the national scientific workforce's global competitiveness. Publications co-authored by REU students, their poster presentations, and their talks will advance and spread knowledge in this broad field of research and applications. The project also includes workshops for professional preparation and development, including preparation for graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
