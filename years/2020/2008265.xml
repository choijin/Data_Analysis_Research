<AbstractNarration>Machine Learning (ML) is being used in new ways to develop intelligent software.  Meanwhile, serverless computing is redefining how to use cloud computing platforms. With serverless computing, ML specialists only need to define a set of stateless functions that have access to a common data store. Current ML software systems are generally specialized for first-generation cloud computing systems that do not have the flexibility required for serverless infrastructures. This project aims to take advantage of serverless computing to deploy machine learning software. This simplifies the deployments, avoids the need for infrastructure maintenance, and includes built-in scalability and cost-control.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Due to the ease of management and ability to rapidly scale, serverless computation has become the trend to build next-generation ML services and applications. This project proposes a unified serverless computing framework that aims to be flexible, agile and efficient for moving ML into the next-generation cloud to achieve better simplicity, manageability and productivity. In particular, to bridge the semantic gap between the serverful ML model and the serverless cloud platform, this project identifies three major tasks:  fine-grained computation management, an efficient communication strategy and a cost-effective service model.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project aims for widespread serverless computing by removing server and operation system level details and simplifying the process of building and managing ML applications. It is a continuum along which developers and operations teams become more accustomed to increased automation and abstraction, and more comfortable breaking ML applications into simple, easy-to- manage microservices, application interfaces, and functions. The result is that developers are free to target the right tools for the right tasks and to build ML applications easily that span any number of different serverless services.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project emphasizes open-source software development. This will enhance the access to stream data analytic frameworks and broaden the project’s impact.  Furthermore, the models and workloads/traces from this project may enable further research by others. The project repository[https://abclab-uncc.github.io/website/grants.html] (data, code, results, emulators, and simulators) will be maintained in the next 5 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
