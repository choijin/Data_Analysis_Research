<AbstractNarration>This project will contribute to the national need for skilled scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the graduation of high-achieving, low-income students at Kalamazoo College.  Over its five-year duration, the project will provide scholarships to 20 full-time students who are pursuing baccalaureate degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, or Physics. Scholars will be recruited and supported in two annual cohorts of ten students each and will receive up to four years of scholarship support.  In addition to receiving scholarships, Scholars will be embedded in a system of evidence-based curricular and co-curricular activities, including activities developed specifically for this project and others that build upon previous efforts.  These student supports include a fall orientation, monthly cohort meetings, field trips, peer mentorship, faculty mentorship focused on the Scholar's Individualized Development Plan, career and professional development, early research experiences, research stipend support, and campus recognition for the Scholars.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need.  The specific aims include: (1) increasing the retention of Scholars in STEM disciplines at a higher rate than peers; (2) fostering Scholars’ sense of belonging, science identity, and community engagement; and 3) ensuring that Scholars graduate with knowledge and skills needed to enter graduate programs or the workforce.  In addition, the project team will conduct a mixed methods research study to investigate the effects of mentoring on Scholars’ sense of belonging, science identity, and degree attainment.  Based on the research literature, national reports, and results from prior National Science Foundation support, this research will use partially mixed concurrent dominant status design to examine the effectiveness of faculty mentoring guided by Individualized Development Plans and a culturally responsive approach to mentoring.  A comprehensive evaluation will be implemented for project improvement and accountability. This project is funded by NSF’s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
