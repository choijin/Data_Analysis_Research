<AbstractNarration>Keeping computers and information systems secure is a major challenge. Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many additional workers who have cybersecurity knowledge and skills. As the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program's national center in the area of security technologies, the National Cybersecurity Training &amp; Education (NCyTE) Center will leverage previous NSF grants, projects funded by the National Security Agency (NSA), and the expertise of partners to provide leadership for cybersecurity education in community and technical colleges and related secondary school programs that build America's skilled technical workforce in cybersecurity. The center will pursue four strategic goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Expand educational pathways and the diversity of cybersecurity programs to meet the nation's workforce needs.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Develop and deploy leading-edge cybersecurity curricula.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Cultivate engagement with employers (business, industry, government) and career opportunities for students.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Disseminate resources to improve current and future directions of cybersecurity education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to Whatcom Community College, major partners in the center include California State University, San Bernardino; Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (Daytona Beach, FL); Eastern New Mexico University - Ruidoso; the Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA; based at Moraine Valley Community College); and the National CyberWatch Center (NCC; based at Prince George's Community College).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To advance cybersecurity education and build the nation's cybersecurity workforce, the NCyTE Center will expand, standardize, and disseminate cutting-edge resources for teaching and learning (including online learning) and best practices aligned with industry standards. The center will develop cybersecurity content targeting new industry sectors, integrate new and updated cybersecurity concepts into existing fields, conduct associated professional development for college and K-12 educators, and coordinate the work of other ATE grantees in cybersecurity. A projected 1,500 faculty will receive training and an estimated 2,300 faculty will engage in annual leadership development workshops and forums to update their knowledge and skills and to learn about needs in industry. Academies and boot camps will address the shortage of cybersecurity faculty. Through forums and career fairs, an estimated 10,000 students will learn about cybersecurity careers and make connections with employers. These activities, as well as targeted outreach and mentoring activities (with a special focus on women, veterans, and Native Americans), will attempt to broaden participation in the field. Using the materials, methods, experiences, and guidance that the center provides, community colleges around the nation will be able to launch, grow, and maintain cybersecurity programs, ultimately expanding and diversifying the pool of graduates who pursue cybersecurity careers. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
