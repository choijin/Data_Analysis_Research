<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Dissertation Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lack of diversification of engineering faculty poses serious threats to the replacement of an aging engineering faculty, the retention of underrepresented minority students, the development of a diverse workforce, and the well-being of the nation. While there have been many initiatives to increase the representation of underrepresented minority faculty, systematic efforts have not been designed to address the completion of doctoral degrees amongst this population. Data show that students, particularly underrepresented students, are leaving before obtaining a degree because of the long, arduous, and uncertain road to graduation. These data also suggest that individuals, graduate schools, and society would benefit from efforts to reduce time-to-degree and degree completion rates. Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to offer a practical and timely experience particularly for underrepresented doctoral students in engineering (African American, Native American, Pacific Island and Hispanic American) to address issues germane to shortening time-to-degree and degree completion rates. The specific aims are to: 1) conduct research to understand the motivational factors that promote and detract from degree progress and 2) to develop and offer the Dissertation Institute (Institute) to provide underrepresented doctoral students in engineering with motivating, helpful strategies for avoiding pitfalls that prolong completion times, particularly those at the dissertation proposal preparation and dissertation completion stages. Current efforts to support underrepresented doctoral students have tended to be local opportunities within specific programs or universities. This project is different from existing efforts because it will systematically examine and positively impact the motivational factors that promote dissertation completion across multiple sites to consider and incorporate contextually relevant factors such that the Institute is transferable across contexts and not limited to local implementation. This transferability is critical to developing a sustainable future program to support underrepresented students. This project addresses strategic goals of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and critical needs of the nation related to enhanced global competitiveness and an improved national economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is grounded in the expectancy-value theory of motivation and will result in two sets of outcomes: research outcomes and direct benefits to participants. Using quantitative and qualitative research methods, the research outcomes will include: 1) contextually relevant and nationally representative research-based data we can use to inform the Institute's design regarding the success beliefs and values that contribute to and detract from students' dissertation success, 2) measures of Institute effectiveness in terms of participant's increased beliefs about succeeding in and the value of completing a dissertation, and 3) a list of variables to which academics should pay attention when designing transferable versions of the Institute. To achieve the outcomes of our study, we have designed a multi-method, multi-phased study. We will examine and draw on stakeholder needs to develop an Institute that is consistent with literature suggestions and effective practices but also contextually relevant for participants. Finally, we will comparatively analyze the data across sites to allow us to identify the key elements on which we should focus in considering transferability of the Institute to additional sites and/or through online means. The research will directly impact approximately 170 underrepresented doctoral students and will contribute to the long-term sustainability of other Institute models. In addition to improving basic writing habits and skills, Institute participants will gain practical strategies for: 1) distinguishing between behaviors that foster or hinder success, 2) increasing engagement in positive behaviors and eliminating destructive behaviors, 3) developing plans to maneuver through the dissertation phase from selecting a topic to completing the dissertation, and 4) establishing realistic program completion goals and plans for implementing those goals. As a result of participation, students will gain specific skills in synthesizing and evaluating findings from the literature to aid in developing a dissertation proposal or for writing a dissertation. They will learn how to identify helpful, credible resources (people, physical and online) and how to use them effectively. Participants will also learn about developing and writing conference papers and publishable manuscripts from the dissertation, an important part of being ready for future employment. In combination, the project outcomes will have immediate impacts on participants while setting the stage for longer-term benefits.</AbstractNarration>
