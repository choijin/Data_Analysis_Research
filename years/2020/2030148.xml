<AbstractNarration>The COVID-19 crisis has had a significant and negative impact on STEM graduate students and their research programs. Universities have been forced to rapidly adapt. Some are developing innovative practices to support graduate students and maintain their programs, yet others are struggling.  This National Science Foundation Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award to the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago aims to support and sustain quality graduate student education in the U.S. during the crisis and into the future.  Graduate school deans will be systematically surveyed about their successes, struggles, and concerns for the future. The findings will be published and distributed to universities nationwide. The report will provide academic leaders with an opportunity to learn from each other. It will document novel and effective solutions developed in real-time during the pandemic and identify the new approaches that should be more fully explored and possibly institutionalized to best support STEM graduate students and sustain graduate programs into the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NORC will follow a reliable and proven research strategy that has been utilized in prior STEM education research, follows established research protocols and methods, and has been successfully executed by NORC in past projects. The Center will design, administer, and analyze an online cross-sectional survey to be completed by graduate school deans on behalf of 300 doctoral- and master’s-level universities in the U.S. that matriculate significant numbers of STEM graduate students.  Initial qualitative interviews with four graduate school deans from diverse institutions will inform the development of the survey instrument. Using both closed- and open-ended questions, the survey will focus on impacts and innovations across three key areas of inquiry: (1) graduate student academic and research progress; (2) graduate student health and well-being; and (3) graduate program continuity and sustainability. Data analysis will include descriptive analyses and statistical tests to identify potential differences across institutional types (e.g., size, highest-degree awarded, minority serving). Qualitative data from the surveys will be coded and organized into the three key areas of inquiry. The survey results will then be shared, vetted, and further refined by a working assembly (virtual or in-person) of approximately 30 representatives from participating institutions. The result will be a final report to be disseminated  through NORC’s website and to STEM graduate programs throughout the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award is made by the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program in the Division of Graduate Education/Directorate of Education and Human Resources using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report for Graduate Schools Respond to COVID-19:   Promising Pathways to Innovation and  Sustainability in STEM Education     This study[1] documents the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to graduate education and illuminates strategies the institutions used to respond to those challenges. The research, comprising a series of expert interviews and a comprehensive national survey followed by a virtual convening, paints a detailed picture of actions taken by U.S. graduate schools as they worked to ensure the academic and research progress and overall well-being of STEM graduate students, and to sustain graduate programs through the pandemic. The study relied on data collected from graduate deans at 208 leading institutions awarding graduate degrees in STEM fields, including 191 of the largest doctoral institutions and 17 of the largest master?s institutions. Within the 208 responding institutions, there were 52 minority-serving institutions.  Key Findings  Research disruptions were rampant: On average, institutions reported 67 percent of their STEM research was delayed or discontinued.  Institutions were unprepared for the shift to online education: Nearly one-half of institutions (48 percent) rated their institution?s technical capacity to provide online learning prior to the pandemic as only marginally or somewhat capable. Less than one in five institutions (18 percent) rated their institutions as fully capable of supporting online/distance learning prior to the onset of COVID-19. Mentoring and advising suffered: Less than one-quarter (24 percent) of institutions reported they agreed that graduate students received consistent advising from graduate faculty during COVID-19, and even fewer (12 percent) said they agreed that virtual advising was an adequate replacement for in-person contact. Graduate deans expressed serious concern for the welfare of students: Students? feelings of loneliness was the most frequently reported concern (37 percent), followed by other mental health concerns (33 percent), and physical health concerns (20 percent). Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and their students were significantly more likely to report technological challenges: MSIs were significantly less likely than predominantly white institutions (PWIs) to report being fully prepared for online instruction prior to COVID-19, and significantly more likely than PWIs to report that their students faced obstacles during the pandemic to access reliable computer hardware and software. International graduate students faced particular challenges during the pandemic: Nearly one-half of institutions (45 percent) reported international students faced large financial impacts (partially due to the inability of some institutions to employ international students who were unable to enter the United States during the pandemic). Additionally, over three-quarters of institutions anticipated either a large (24 percent) or moderate (54 percent) decrease in international graduate student retention. Budget cuts loom: About two-thirds (67 percent) of institutions reported they anticipated needing to cut the budget of their graduate school or programs as a result of the pandemic and its consequences. Retention is anticipated to decrease: 32 percent forecast a moderate decrease of domestic student retention, and over three-quarters anticipated a decrease in international student retention. Graduate students? career prospects are dimming: For PhD graduates, 91 percent of deans expected either a significant (36 percent) or slight (55 percent) decline in placements. For master?s graduates, 84 percent of deans reported either a significant (22 percent) or a slight (62 percent) decline in securing jobs upon graduation.   Broader Implications Highlighted by the Research  This study documented human and institutional costs triggered by COVID-19. Several institutional respondents noted the pandemic highlighted broader issues of social and racial justice that continue to persist on campus and in particular within STEM fields. Although this study did not directly address the specific ways in which the pandemic has exacerbated racial and ethnic disparities, the data highlighted the critical need for future research to identify and assess the impact of COVID-19 on graduate students and the larger STEM enterprise across the United States.
