<AbstractNarration>While large scale quarantine has been the most successful short-term policy, it is not efficient over long periods as it exerts economic costs. That is why countries which have been able to partially control the spread of the coronavirus disease are now thinking about policies to reopen businesses. However, healthcare systems strongly warn against reopening too soon. Thus, it is urgent consider a flexible quarantine policy that balanced these demands. The novelty of this work is in suggesting a multi-level quarantine process based on the mobility patterns of individuals and the severity of COVID-19 contagion in different areas. Broader impacts of this research will be recommendation to long-term policies on coronavirus control, which explicitly takes state cooperation into account, as neighboring states are not necessarily disconnected, according to mobility patterns. Additionally, this research will provide professional development opportunities for early career researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research provides a more adaptive isolation and quarantine process based on actual individuals' mobility patterns. Specifically, it advances the state of knowledge regarding 1) how to define the borders of high-risk patches considering the location and movements of confirmed patients, 2) what is the risk of each patch based on the strength of connectivity between these patches, 3) how this information enables policymakers to make better and faster decisions across the scales, and 4) how models can better simulate the epidemic spread within and among societies. Social fragmentation will be analyzed by applying the Louvain method with modularity optimization to the mobility network. In a multi-scale community detection process, high risk areas will be defined. At the smaller scales, for communities with a higher number of confirmed cases the influence of contact tracing and quarantine policies will be considered. A stochastic transmission model will be built to study how the coronavirus spreads in society and how it affects individuals' health. To develop the model, parameters such as incubation time distribution of asymptotic patients, daily test capacity, and the number of mild, hospitalized, ICU hospitalized, recovered, and death cases will be considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have tried to control transmission using a combination of local restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing often termed ?lockdowns" to reduce transmission locally, and travel restrictions to prevent importing new cases. Travel restrictions include limiting non-essential travel, and imposing mandatory quarantines for travelers. While lockdowns are the most successful policy adopted to reduce transmission, governments that have seen some success in controlling the spread of the disease, often relaxed restrictions too early or did not control boundaries sufficiently leading to a cycle of rapidly rising cases and repeated lockdowns. In the US, in most cases, lockdown and quarantine policies, and data related to the COVID-19 outbreak are based on arbitrary borders such as state or county boundary lines. While these boundaries may serve constituents for certain social needs (e.g. tax accounting and infrastructure management), this is not the most effective way to analyze data for anticipating and controlling disease outbreaks. This is apparent when considering urban areas that straddle state borders.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this project, we have analyzed mobility data in the US collected by SafeGraph to extract self-organized mobility patches from individual mobility data. Mobility patches/communities refer to the areas within which people who travel locally spend most of their time. These patches represent socially and economically connected areas based on movements of their residents. In our research using a multi-scale community detection process, and the epidemiological identification of identified COVID-19 cases, we determined natural travel breakpoints, as well as high-risk areas for contagion, at three scales. We then designed a novel multi-level geographic region quarantine process based on the heterogeneity in mobility patterns of individuals and the severity of COVID-19 contagion in the US.&nbsp;</p> <p>Based on the mobility data before/during/after lockdowns in 2020, we showed that lockdowns and movement restrictions reduced the mobility of individuals, at all scales, and split the pre-pandemic mobility patches into smaller areas. Patches are smaller in the city areas and wider in the surrounding and rural areas representing longer distance rural travel. We show that the identification of the real world dynamics of individuals can influence strategies for limiting mobility leading to transmission as well as to suggest how to relax restrictions by these geographical regions with significantly reduced risk of transmission. Commuting from/to high-risk patches increases the chance of the spread of the disease to other patches so selective restrictions can improve pandemic response as well as economic activity. Moreover, effective contact tracing and associated quarantine policies can be informed by the community structure pointing to where individuals are more likely to be infected as a result of current patterns of transmission within the community. Through simulation of the virus spread using an SEIR model on the map of the mobility patches of the US, we found that lockdowns based upon mobility patches can be more successful in slowing down the spread of pandemics and reducing the number of cases.&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, it is urgent to consider a flexible policy by geographical region that limits transmission without requiring more than short duration lockdowns. By identifying the natural boundaries of social mobility, policymakers can impose both lockdown and travel restrictions that are minimally disruptive to social and economic activity.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/06/2021<br>      Modified by: Leila&nbsp;Hedayatifar</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2032536/2032536_10675904_1627632176650_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2032536/2032536_10675904_1627632176650_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fragmentation pattern of the mobility networks of the US for February 23-29 (panel A) and April 5-11 (panel B)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2032536/2032536_10675904_1627632176650_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fragmentation pattern of the mobility networks of the US for February 23-29 (panel A) and April 5-11 (panel B)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Patches and clusters of patches are shown by different colors and color hues.
