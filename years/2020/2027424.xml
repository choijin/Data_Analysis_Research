<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for rapid testing, analysis, and tracking. The innovation provides access to next-generation sequence technologies to healthcare facilities, as well as a centralized system to integrate and share hospital-level data with microbial information to be shared on any geographic scale. The platform automates the analysis of bacterial and viral data, delivering simplified and clinically relevant results via interactive web interfaces. The proposed technology offers important data to clinicians and other experts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to generate the largest collection of SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes with matched respiratory microbiomes for clinicians to rapidly test medical hypotheses for diagnostic and prescriptive use. Our project has three major objectives: 1) incorporate an automated analytical pipeline to process whole genomes of infecting strains of SARS-CoV-2; 2) integrate viral genomes with patient microbiomes and clinical records, and; 3) deliver clear, easy-to-interpret results via an interactive web interface. The infection control cloud-based software platform solution enables “precision epidemiology” integrating pathogen genomics with clinical and patient demographics to improve patient outcomes and enhance the capability of the health system for infection control and surveillance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
