<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of topologically-optimized heat exchangers that may be additively manufactured. By extending topology optimization onto three-dimensional conjugate heat transfer systems and by accounting for additive manufacturing constraints, this project will demonstrate the relevance and utility of both technologies. Because of the focus on heat exchanger technology as the demonstration platform, the work also may improve energy efficiency for a host of convection related applications, ranging from automotive to aerospace, power conversion, refrigeration, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will apply topology optimization to design novel heat exchangers and consider additive manufacturing constraints during the optimization process. The key innovation in the proposed research allows density-based topology optimization to control design-dependent physical boundary conditions. The resulting heat exchanger may be additively manufactured and tested both for performance as well as durability in order to show that the topology optimization process is acceptable for this type of application, which is highly constrained along multiple competing aspects (i.e., thermal performance, pressure drop, thermal stress, burst pressure, creep, etc.). This developed technology may lead to new heat exchangers that dissipate more heat than conventional ones by exploring a large design space opened by additive manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The major goals were to understand commerical potential of topologically optimzied heat sinks and to educate academic students the importance of a product market fit using their innovation from research as a product. The objective was completing at least 100 interviews over 7 weeks to identify the target market.        Over 100 interviews were completed. Poor market inferences were identified saving resources from being applied to an underdeveloped startup. The project provided the opportunity to practice interviewing, develop networks, and experience startup culture. Experience with the brutal difficulty of bringing innovation to market was essential to future industry development.  The two graduate students working together developed their understanding of each other and work habits that enhanced their performance in and outside of this project.    This project makes it possible for two young professionals to engage with leaders across automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing industries.  This project has led to enhanced understanding of the current market for high performance, high value heat exchangers. The knowledge of current products, suppliers, customers, manufacturers as well as companies? methods of acquiring heat exchangers was developed. The potential for market opportunity depends on this understanding as well as the connections developed in the I-Corps outreach. Through the completion of 100 in-person interviews, the team built a foundation of industry contacts and networks to use in the development of the innovation.  Beyond heat exchangers, additive manufacturing, and topology optimization, the team receive useful education in entrepreneurial ventures. The team now see an idea as an opportunity and can observe how the idea can or cannot fit in the world of industry.   This project has ignited the potential for the commercialization of topologically optimized heat exchangers made with additive manufacturing.
