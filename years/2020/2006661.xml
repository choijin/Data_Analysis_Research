<AbstractNarration>Modern technologies, like cellular devices and other sophisticated sensors, have made possible the collection of large volumes of data. &lt;br/&gt;In many applications the resulting data may arrive from different sources and at different times, or the amount of information is so large &lt;br/&gt;that it is impossible to analyze or store in a single computer. Examples of such applications include analytics in the cloud, &lt;br/&gt;or inference from databases distributed across a network of devices for privacy and/or security reasons.&lt;br/&gt;The need to analyze this type of data has prompted a growing class of mathematical, statistical and computational challenges,&lt;br/&gt;where distributed measurements need to be assembled to draw conclusions about a system. To date most research &lt;br/&gt;has focused on the computational question of efficiently and accurately synchronizing/aligning distributed data,&lt;br/&gt;but less is known about how to address the mathematical impediments to finding such solutions. &lt;br/&gt;This is the knowledge gap this project seeks to address. Specifically, the investigator will develop&lt;br/&gt;the theoretical, mathematical and algorithmic foundations needed to learn from distributed data,&lt;br/&gt;even when total synchronization is not possible. The tools developed in this project will advance pure and computational mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;and have the potential to be applied in areas such as cloud computing, distributed data visualization and sensor fusion. &lt;br/&gt;The impact of this research will be further amplified by its inclusion into novel educational materials developed by the investigator,&lt;br/&gt;as well as in the training of computational scientists and mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme in this project is the adaptation of tools from classical algebraic topology -- the branch of mathematics concerned with &lt;br/&gt;the shape of abstract objects and how local constructions interact -- to the problem of learning from distributed data. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research funded by this award seeks to: (1) leverage ideas from sheaf theory in order to develop algorithms &lt;br/&gt;capable of estimating, from data, the topological obstructions to the global synchronization of distributed measurements; and, &lt;br/&gt;(2) to utilize tools from the theory of fiber bundles to compute consistent assemblages of local data,&lt;br/&gt;even in the presence of non-trivial obstructions. The proposed work will also lead to novel algorithms for data&lt;br/&gt;synchronization via symmetries in Lie (e.g., matrix) groups, and analyses where the synchronization problem can be solved only approximately. &lt;br/&gt;This novel adaptation of tools from fiber bundles in conjunction with sheaf theory and Cech cohomology&lt;br/&gt;will present new challenges and application opportunities at the bleeding edge of pure and computational mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
