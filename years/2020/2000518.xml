<AbstractNarration>Women have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields, and research evidence suggests that subtle gender bias occurs in many STEM settings, especially those where women continue to be underrepresented. Social psychological research has demonstrated the negative effects of perceived bias or becoming aware that one is the target of stereotyping and discrimination. This project will provide a novel contribution to and extension of the perceived bias research by proposing that simply witnessing instances of subtle gender bias can have differential effects on observers depending on whether they recognize the event as an instance of gender stereotyping. When witnesses observe stereotypic interactions but do not perceive them as instances of gender stereotyping, the interactions serve as a subtle stereotype cue that promotes stereotype-supporting outcomes. When witnesses to bias do recognize the stereotypic interactions as instances of gender stereotyping, the interactions serve as a blatant stereotype cue promoting stereotype-defying outcomes. The researchers will undertake a series of studies designed to experimentally test the effects of subtle vs. blatant stereotype activation (cued by witnessing bias on men and women in computer science and engineering contexts) focusing on performance, motivation, evaluation of peers, and group dynamics. The findings will inform ongoing and future intervention efforts aimed at raising awareness of and mitigating negative effects of gender bias in the STEM environment. The proposed project is a joint effort between the University of Michigan Ann Arbor and Michigan Technological University and is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research effort will advance the discovery and understanding of mechanisms by which the presence of subtle gender bias influences the climate for men and women in STEM by specifically exploring process differences for blatant and implicit bias cues. The work will provide insight into the influences of these cues on performance and motivation among women, as well as the behaviors of men and women in groups and on teams. One strength of this work is the use of experimental methodology (i.e. randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to study the effects of witnessing subtle bias. Using RCTs provides a rigorous test of a causal relationship between exposure to subtle bias and its purported consequences. Moreover, this research project will also expand research and theory on the effects of experienced discrimination, by examining these effects on witnesses of bias, including men, with important downstream consequences. By exploring these relationships, the research will afford better understanding of how the awareness and attribution of subtle gender bias may modify outcomes for everyone in the setting. This understanding may inform ongoing and future intervention efforts aimed at raising awareness of and mitigating negative outcomes of gender bias in the STEM environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
