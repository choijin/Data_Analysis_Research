<AbstractNarration>This new Research Experience for Undergraduate Students (REU) Site will initiate a cohesive program at the Center for Clean Energy Engineering (C2E2) and the School of Engineering at the University of Connecticut (UCONN) to engage talented minority and underrepresented undergraduate participants in research on hydrogen (H2) technologies. The program will offer a diverse cohort of undergraduate students the opportunity to engage in research to advance multidisciplinary approaches needed to address national emerging challenges in H2 production, storage and utilization for the development of a sustainable energy future. C2E2 in collaboration with a diverse group of academic and industrial partners will build and invest into the training of young engineers and provide them with the necessary tools to achieve society’s transition to the H2 economy. More than ten faculty members from various departments at the School of Engineering and the School of Law at UCONN will provide integrated education, training, and hands-on interdisciplinary research opportunities that spark the imagination of students towards an exceptional STEM workforce of future engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year interdisciplinary REU Site at UCONN will mentor and train a total of 30 undergraduate students in H2 related technologies. The students will participate directly in research with clear contributions to addressing challenges in development of H2 technologies. Two unique elements of this REU Site are the active engagement of industrial partners and the integration of environmental policy and law. The core objectives of this REU site are: (i) Increase the quantity and quality of scientists and engineers prepared to address challenges on H2 technologies; (ii) Increase the number of students from underrepresented populations including minorities, to pursue graduate education and careers in academic or industrial research in H2 related fields; and (iii) Build alliances with minority-serving institutions and programs to enable a sustainable network of underrepresented students who will become leaders in H2 related fields. In addition to active research projects, students will participate in career development seminars, which will involve fundamentals and technical aspects of H2 technologies, environmental policies and law and real-world industrial practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
