<AbstractNarration>This COVID-19 RAPID research program will develop a geographically integrated knowledge graph to support data scientists and decision-makers in industry and the government in taking region-specific steps towards reopening the country. Towards this goal, the project will combine data from themes as diverse as transportation, social distancing measures, demographic and environmental factors, as well as economic impacts. Knowledge graphs are contextualization technologies. They enable their users to gain a more holistic understanding of complex social and scientific questions by providing actionable insights from neighboring disciplines. For instance, making decisions about local economies and food systems require an understanding of the frequently changing social distancing measures, traffic control and restrictions including  neighboring regions,  demographic factors, and the percentage of recovered citizens. The project will work together with industry partners to understand how graphed knowledge can be utilized in their forecasting models. Finally, the project will reach out to other knowledge graphs to jointly form an open knowledge network related to COVID-19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    More technically, we will utilize a stack of open source technologies and international standards to develop a highly integrated Linked Data-based knowledge graph that combines cross-domain data across different geographic scales and types of places.  We will utilize machine learning technologies to learn graph embeddings for predicting links within our graph as well as alignments to other graphs by using places such as cities or counties as points of integration. We will also provide the functionality to collaborate with the broader schema.org effort. We are particularly interested in studying how to represent and align COVID-19 data that is currently being reported at different geographic scales and aggregates, thereby fostering interoperability and breaking up data silos. We will work directly with our industry partners on engineering (spatially-explicit) features from our and external graphs. These features will be integrated into industry downstream forecasting models with a particular focus on food systems. Finally, We will utilize the expertise of our partners in creating visual data dashboards to better communicate our findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Understanding the social drivers of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak may be as important as understanding the virus itself. One such social driver is misinformation and distrust in institutions. This is particularly interesting as the scientific process is more transparent than ever before. Numerous scientific teams have published datasets that cover almost any imaginable aspect of COVID-19. However, consistently and efficiently integrating and making sense of these separate data &lsquo;silos&rsquo; remains a key challenge with important implications for transparency. For instance, it may be unclear to the public which forecasts are used to decide on new, regional COVID policies. Several types of knowledge graphs have been published to tackle this issue, enable data crosswalks, and provide contextual information. Interestingly, none of these graphs has focused on COVID-19 forecasts despite them acting as the underpinning for decision-making. In this project, we addressed this shortcoming by publishing an open, standards-conform, and continuously updated knowledge graph of all major COVID forecasts (over 50) for the United States on the level of states and counties, together with the assumptions underlying these forecast models and other relevant metadata. Together with the actual COVID cases, this allows users to compare forecasts across geographic regions rapidly. Such comparison reveals a substantial geographic variability among forecasts. Put differently, models that perform well in some states and counties fall short in other regions by a wide margin. This is very important as it shows the need for regionalized forecasts. We also combine our COVID forecast graph with several economic indicators and link states and counties to other major knowledge graphs such as Wikidata. This enables users to ask questions such as which forecast shows the strongest correlation to population density. In addition, we also investigated the scope (area of influence) of regional COVID policies as they relate to types of places such as restaurants or car dealerships. Intuitively, regions such as counties may make their policy decisions in isolation, but their effect is felt across neighboring counties. This can be described in terms of the mobility patterns of place types. For example, policies for Las Vegas (Clark County) have a substantially larger reach geographical than for most other US counties.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/05/2021<br>      Modified by: Krzysztof&nbsp;W&nbsp;Janowicz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
