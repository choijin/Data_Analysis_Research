<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by improving the preparation of undergraduate pre-service teachers through the design, development, and adoption of a digital platform that supports effective teaching of engineering design to children.  The project intends to create and test the online teaching and learning platform, ChangeMaker K-12, through engagement of 40 pre-service teachers (PSTs) who will assist in the development and piloting of the materials over five semesters.  ChangeMaker K-12 will be designed as a platform for delivering high quality learning opportunities in engineering and human-centered design for PSTs and elementary school children.  Ultimately, the project aims to provide a free website with materials and guiding steps to support innovative habits and problem-solving processes in PSTs and in elementary aged students.  These materials are meant to be useful to students in classrooms, informal education settings, and homes.  For each phase of the process, the platform will provide step-by-step protocols, with built-in videos and games that assist in engaging in design thinking with fidelity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This design-based-research project aims to empower undergraduate K-5 PSTs to confidently engage K-5 students in engineering processes through the design, development, and adoption of a free online platform with resources that support effective teaching of engineering design and human-centered design accessible to marginalized youth.  The project has four key features. First is early and continuous involvement of PSTs in design-based research cycle. Second is a platform designed for adoption and propagation. Third is the testing of the platform in both an undergraduate teacher preparation program and high poverty low performing schools. And fourth is its dissemination to teacher preparation programs in Louisiana as well as professional organizations.  An iterative design process will be used to develop the materials and supports that will be available through the ChangeMaker K-12 platform.  The resources will be designed to scaffold preservice teachers in learning and experiences in solving real world problems through practitioner inquiry.  Resources and support for engaging elementary school children in engineering and human-centered design is core to the platform strategy.  The project intends to share the materials and project findings with its community partners including six public school systems, Boys and Girls Club of Acadiana, and the United Way of Acadiana.  Dissemination of materials and findings will also include peer teacher preparation programs in Louisiana and through professional organizations with a focus on educational technology and teacher preparation.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.  The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) Program is providing co-funding for this IUSE: EHR project to support the project's preservice teacher preparation goals, which are well-aligned with Noyce Program goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
