<AbstractNarration>1434548 (Ierapetritou), 1434456 (Vlachos)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need to minimize anthropogenic CO2 emissions and our dependence on foreign fossil fuels has been a main driver for the discovery and development of renewable and sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from other sources. Toward this goal, non-edible lignocellulosic biomass (plant biomass composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) is a promising renewable feedstock since it is abundant, does not directly compete with the food chain, can lead to nearly carbon-free processes with concomitant reduction in CO2 emissions, and contains the building block of chemicals and fuels, i.e., carbon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been estimated that the annual crude oil demands in the US are of the same order of magnitude as the potentially available quantities of lignocellulosic materials and the throughput of chemicals is significantly lower, compared to fuels, and can easily be met. The recent boom in shale gas reduces our dependence on foreign petroleum, but also reduces the cracking of naphtha and thus, the production of C3-C6 chemicals from fossil fuels. One such example is BTX (Benzene, Toluene, Xylenes). Among BTX constituents, p-xylene (pX) is of great interest since it is the foundation for terephthalic acid (a polymer precursor for PET bottles used for the vast majority of food and liquid containers) and has an annual global demand of ~35 million metric tons/yr in 2010. The consumption of PET is expected to increase by 4-5%/yr over the next five years. pX has a similar number of carbon atoms to the building blocks of lignocellulose, and thus, its renewable production is an appealing target and forms the basis of the case study of the proposed work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Penetration of biomass based chemicals into existing markets requires that their production is sustainable and cost competitive to that of the petrochemical counterparts. Economic analysis and life cycle analysis (LCA) are often conducted to evaluate new biomass-based processes. It is emphatically the case that such predictions (including our own work) are based on rudimentary information, e.g., overall yield, and as such, are very uncertain. Currently, catalysts, solvents, and separation schemes are by-and-large discovered by trial and error. This situation is reminiscent of the genesis of oil industry that was followed by a century of discovery to evolve to its current mature stage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to realize renewable routes in the foreseeable future, a paradigm shift in philosophy and strategy is necessary that leverages recent scientific advances and core capabilities. It is the thesis of this research that a symbiotic program between systems analysis and fundamental science can lead to knowledge-based discovery and rapid commercialization while advancing scientific frontiers. This grand challenge-based vision defines the intellectual merit of the proposed program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: To meet this grand challenge-based objective, a "hierarchical multiscale" program is planned, where systems analysis is informing the fundamental science of key processes and parameters, and the science team is performing experiments and simulations to collect this much needed knowledge to reduce systems uncertainty and render systems predictions reliable. In simple terms, the systems analysis focuses the space of scientific research and accelerates knowledge generation, where it makes sense to have, and the science in turn makes economic and life cycle analyses more reliable. The conversion of biomass-derived sugars to para-xylene has been selected as a representative case study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed work will have impact on the specific domain of catalytic kinetics, separation technology, systems analysis, and the overall goal of establishing a sustainable manufacturing route of valuable chemicals from lignocellulose. The introduction of renewable chemicals can have a major impact on US economic development and sustainability. Similar to petro-based refineries, process synthesis will unavoidably play a vital role in sustainable and cost-effective biorefineries. The hierarchical multiscale program proposed herein can also pave the way of future research efforts between disciplines toward accelerated discovery and genesis of knowledge where is most impactful. The results will be disseminated broadly through publications, lectures, and integration of research findings within the graduate and undergraduate curricula of the two institutions involved. Graduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary science, including catalysis, reaction engineering, separation sciences, and process systems engineering, by establishing a new way of thinking in the development of a sustainable chemical process. In addition, the PIs will broaden participation of students from underrepresented groups and provide an enriching experience to K-12 students through a variety of educational activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Award Title:&nbsp; SusChem Collaborative Research:</strong> <strong>Process Optimization of Novel Routes for the Production of bio-based Para-Xylene</strong></p> <p>Biomass has been identified as a promising resource that can replace the use of fossil fuels as it can be used to produce both high-volume and low-value fuels and chemicals. The main aim of this work is to explore the novel production alternatives to manufacture para-Xylene, a pre-cursor for plastics, from biomass feedstocks to realize renewable production in the future optimizing environmental impacts and economic performance. We developed an integrated framework implementing process design, simulation, heat integration, life cycle assessment (LCA) and process optimization as shown in Figure 1 in order to achieve more economically and environmentally friendly production alternative.</p> <p>Bio-based p-xylene has drawn considerable attention because it is the main precursor for polyester polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), and thus the focus of this work. We first investigated the production of p-xylene with HMF as the raw material and subsequently extended the boundary towards lignocellulosic biomass. A novel process of hydrolysis using molten salt hydrate was investigated and integrated to reduce the production cost. As seen in Figure 2, the minimum selling prices calculated of bio-based p-Xylene (which corresponds to zero profit) is comparable with oil-based p-Xylene. We have managed to gradually decrease the minimum selling price of p-Xylene throughout the years by using low-cost starting raw materials and improving catalyst selectivity and yield.</p> <p>To further improve economics and sustainability, furfural and lignin, which are by-product produced from p-Xylene production, is used to produce butadiene, surfactants, jet-fuels and lubricants from furfural, and pressure sensitive adhesives from lignin to maximize the profit potential of the bio-refinery as shown in Figure 3. The minimum selling price of bio-based chemicals is comparable with oil-based chemicals. The bio-refinery still depends on oil-based resources such as hydrogen, different acids and aldehydes and all the solvents, that increase the environmental emissions that should be further investigated. Better optimization of the heat networks and utilities should be carried out to reduce the overall economics and increase the sustainability of the bio-refinery. Long residence time and requirement of huge volume of solvent are some of the bottlenecks in the process, which increases the capital and operating costs.</p> <p>A general framework of process flowsheet optimization which incorporates the surrogate-based model for each detailed unit to retain the accuracy using the detailed kinetics and thermodynamics models is shown in Figure 4 and the production of HMF, LA, and FA from glucose using reactive extraction and reactive adsorption are studied. The production of reactive extraction is slightly cheaper than that of reactive adsorption. The framework of process flowsheet optimization using surrogate-based models is extended to multi-criteria optimization of the bio-refinery which considers not only of economic objective but also environmental impacts. A multi-objective optimization formulation for biomass refinery configuration (Figure 5) considering uncertainties and process modularization is studied to determine the pareto set of solutions, including optimal selection of feedstocks, processing technology, and a set of products to maximize the profit and minimize the environmental impacts (Figure 6).</p> <p>Once the optimal pathway is obtained, modularization of the bio-refinery is carried out by defining the processes with a set of standard modules. Introducing modularization provides additional flexibility where capital cost savings can be achieved for higher processing capacities. In doing so, the effect of design standardization was quantified with the help of economies of numbers. The proposed framework for simultaneously addressing the environmental impact and modular process design can be extended to a multi echelon supply chain optimization problem, where supply chain level decisions can be incorporated into process design. Process feasibility can thus be ensured even for the case where the process is described using a complex simulation. The biorefinery superstructure considered in this work can be extended to consider the third generation of biomass as well as different bio-based processes such as fermentation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br>
