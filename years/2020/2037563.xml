<AbstractNarration>This grant will support research that will contribute new knowledge related to nonlinear dynamics and wave propagation through classical and quantum mechanical bistable structures, which is critical for phononic quantum computing. Current state-of-the-art quantum computers complete complex computations at unprecedented speeds; however, they require very low operating temperatures, limiting their practical use. Further, the current lack of a well-established tunneling junction capable of processing phononic quantum information limits progress in phononic quantum computing. Bistable structures are a promising approach for the realization of a mechanical tunneling junction because, at the nanoscale, their energy barrier approaches the energy of a single phonon. This award supports fundamental research to provide the knowledge regarding the nonlinear dynamics of classical and quantum mechanical bistable structures needed for the development of these novel tunneling junctions. These tunneling junctions will be used for processing and computing of quantum information carried by single phonons and will dramatically advance the technology of room-temperature quantum computing. This capability will advance knowledge in dynamics, quantum physics, nanoscience, and nanofabrication. This research will benefit U.S. society due to the critical need for high performance computing in science, defense and industry. This multi-disciplinary research will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering and positively impact STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate the fundamental nonlinear dynamics and wave transmission through mechanical bistable structures in classical and quantum regimes for their potential application as mechanical tunneling junctions. Such mechanical tunneling junctions will process quantum bits, which is critical to quantum computing platforms using phonons. The central hypothesis of this research is that a nanoscale bistable structure can transmit mechanical waves (phonons) with a high enough transmission efficiency to act as a quantum tunneling junction if the structure is driven by nonlinear and contactless conservative interactions. This hypothesis will be tested in both classical and quantum regimes by 1) characterizing the snap-though dynamics and wave transmission of macroscale bistable elements with contact interactions and nonlinear conservative (contactless) interactions, 2) evaluating the mechanical wave (phonon) transmission efficiency through a micro-scale structure theoretically and experimentally, and 3) demonstrating the quantum dynamics of phonon tunneling through mechanical tunneling junction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
