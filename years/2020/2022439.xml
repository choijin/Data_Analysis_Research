<AbstractNarration>The United States has historically been the global leader in the interdisciplinary field of the learning sciences, which involves the study of teaching and learning in contexts ranging from children learning math in school, to adults learning highly technical jobs in the workforce. Research in the learning sciences draws from diverse methodologies and domains, including the fields of psychology, sociology, linguistics, design studies, cognitive science, and computer science. The preeminent conference in this field is the International Society of Learning Sciences Conference (ICLS). At this conference the latest research is presented and practitioners learn the state of the art techniques that support the research and design of learning interventions, integrated with advanced technologies. This project supports a Doctoral Consortium and Early Career Workshop for approximately 10-20 attendees, providing opportunities for the participants to interact with international researchers and practitioners. The conference and related activities will address important challenges associated with the transformation of education and broadening of participation in the digital age. The conference will be held virtually this year due to Covid-19. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon prior ICLS conferences, several activities and mentoring for participants will be included-  both before, during and after the conference. Prior to the conference, doctoral consortium participants will interact with assigned mentors to discuss research interests and prepare a research presentation covering dissertation progress. During the workshop, they will share this presentation in an interactive format, facilitated by the mentors. After the conference, activities will include online discussions to extend the workshop experience. Activities for the Early Career Workshop are similar, but with a focus on community building and professional development, including mentoring regarding tenure and career path. All participants will interact with a career panel, journal editors, and with each other in a virtual reception. The activities are important to build capacity and support new researchers in the interdisciplinary areas of the computer and learning sciences, supporting participants who then go on to mentor graduate students and other junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the planning and conduct of the Doctoral Consortium (DC) and Early Career Workshop (ECW) at the International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) in 2020. These DC and ECW convenings are high-visibility capacity building opportunities that support and elevate the work of doctoral and early career researchers. Given their role in the learning science research community, ensuring diverse participation in these convenings and providing strategic capacity building and networking opportunities for participants at these convenings is an important challenge for the ICLS planning teams.  This project supported planning efforts, including recruiting senior researchers, research funders, publication editors, and so on to structure convening opportunities.The project supported doctoral and early career researchers’ participation in the convenings via stipends to cover conference registration fees. Project activities, which were grounded in commitments to inclusion and equity, resulted in a cohort of DC and ECW participants who were diverse in terms of geographic location, institution, gender, race/ethnicity, and subject matter focus.  With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, planning teams reoriented convening activities to accomplish their original goals in virtual formats. Surveys were conducted to ascertain participatns technical and logistical challenges in joining multiple virtual meetings. Based on survey resutls, DC and ECW co-chairs planned sessions using a variety of formats to ensure maximal participation across DC and ECW attendees.   Several synchronous meetings in which panels of gusest speajers were held, focused on topics identified through participant surveys. The panel titles were: 1. Meeting Journal Editors; 2. Collaboration and Ethics in the Learning Sciences; 3. Career Trajectories; and, 4. Funding.  Participants also met in small groups to present and discuss their research; these teams met with a DC organizer and two external guests whose research reflected the interests of the participants. Finally, organizers also held virtual "coffee hours" that were open to participants to meet and discuss whatever issues were of interest to them.  Participant researchers and their work was supported and elevated within the learning science research community via inclusion in the conference proceedings, networking among researchers as part of convening activities, and via conference communications to organization members about the DC and ECW participants’ ongoing research.
