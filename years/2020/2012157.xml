<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in the sustainable and economic retrofitting of low-performing older buildings toward improved economic, social and ecological impacts of built environments. More than half of all commercial buildings were constructed before the 1980s with lower energy standards.  The owners and occupants of these buildings now often seek better energy management and air quality technologies. The microalgae window developed in this Phase I project is an energy-efficient, easy-to-install, adaptable modular unit for different retrofitting applications, able to compete with conventional windows due to its good air quality and renewable energy potentials. Gains in worker productivity from microalgae window retrofit are estimated to be substantial and building values at sale or rental are expected to increase significantly due to building envelope improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop an innovative, cost-effective microalgae window for retrofitting low-performing commercial windows. Microalgae are an effective biological system for carbon capture and biomass production from photosynthesis. The microalgae window incorporates a network of screens filled with microalgae within a window assembly to replace or add to older windows for energy-efficient retrofitting. The microalgae screen within a window assembly is able to balance multiple functions of thermal insulation, daylight transmission, solar shading efficacy, and views to outside. Research objectives are to: 1) characterize the optimal microalgae window system for pre-1980 office retrofitting applications; 2) verify environmental performance using computer simulations and lab experimentation in accordance with industry standards; and 3) conduct field testing to evaluate building energy savings, indoor air quality improvement and renewable energy production potentials.  The new microalgae window mitigates energy transfer between indoor and outdoor environments, subsequently reducing heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilation demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Capitalizing on multifunctionality of microalgae?s superior biomass production and carbon capture by photosynthesis, microalgae window retrofitting is able to save building energy consumption by 20~30% in heating, cooling, and artificial lighting load from its effective summer shading, good winter solar heating, and year-around daylighting penetration. Additional benefits are related to sequestering CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and producing high value biomass from microaglae productiion. With an automatic control system, the microalgae window is able to control its tint and color to further enhance energy savings and user comfort while providing system?s longevity and easy maintenance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>R&amp;D objectives during the STTR Phase I include 1) selection of an optimum configuration of the microalgae window taking into consideration of building energy performance (e.g. climate responsive shading, solar heating and ventilation and daylighting penetration) and optimum microalgae growing environmental factors (e.g. temp, sunlight, aeration, pH, nutrients etc); 2) verification of energy efficiency measures in the&nbsp;lab settings in the area of U-factor, Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC), and Visible Light Transmittance (VLT) of a microalgae window; and, 3) field performance measurements of energy efficiency measures, CO2 reduction, and microalgae growth.</p> <p>The team successfully completed a full scale prototype and verified energy efficiency of the technology in both the lab and real-world field settings in accordance with industry standards. We measured dynamic thermal insulation, solar heat mitigation, and daylighting illumination which are important performance metrics for building energy efficiency. Field performance measurements further verified the value propositions related to building energy savings and additional practical issues to transform R&amp;D research into the construction market. We tested five different microalgae strains,&nbsp;<em>Chlorella,</em>&nbsp;<em>Chlorococcum</em>,&nbsp;<em>Haematococcus pluvialis, Scenedesmus obliquus, and Spirulina&nbsp;</em>according to growth hardness, aesthetics and useful bioproducts.

This crisis will inevitably lead to a worldwide need to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions. Buildings-related carbon&nbsp;emissions have continued to rise by around 1% per year. The building sector accounts for approximately 40% of US energy use and 39% of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions from building operations.&nbsp; Low performing windows are responsible for more than half of the building energy consumption and pollutant emissions.&nbsp;Energy efficient window retrofit plays an important role in improving workplace performance as well as asset values. Aesthetic and performative enhancement from microalgae window retrofitting can improve worker?s productivity gains due to work dedication and less sick leaves. The biological integration of the microalgae window provides appealing aesthetics and emotional comfort. The decarbonization capability further benefits not only occupant health and well-being but also provides financial incentives from a carbon credit, making the microalgae window more appealing to occupants, industry professionals, and stakeholders.&nbsp;Microalgae windows can offer environmental, economic, and commercial opportunities toward a healthy, carbon neutral built environment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/04/2021<br>      Modified by: Kyoung Hee&nbsp;Kim</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840729279_full_daytime--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840729279_full_daytime--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Microalgae Window Prototype 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840729279_full_daytime--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Microalgae Window Prototype 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">microalgae window daytime view</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kyoung Hee Kim</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kyoung Hee&nbsp;Kim</div> <div class="imageTitle">Microalgae Window Prototype 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840827222_full_nighttime--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840827222_full_nighttime--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Microalgae Window Prototype 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840827222_full_nighttime--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Microalgae Window Prototype 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">microalgae window night view</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kyoung Hee Kim</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kyoung Hee&nbsp;Kim</div> <div class="imageTitle">Microalgae Window Prototype 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840910783_closeup_daytime--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840910783_closeup_daytime--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Microalgae Window Prototype 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840910783_closeup_daytime--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Microalgae Window Prototype 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">microalgae close-up daytime</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kyoung Hee Kim</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kyoung Hee&nbsp;Kim</div> <div class="imageTitle">Microalgae Window Prototype 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840968977_closeup_nighttime--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840968977_closeup_nighttime--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Microalgae Window Prototype 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2012157/2012157_10672686_1622840968977_closeup_nighttime--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Microalgae Window Prototype 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">microalgae close-up night time</div> <div class="imageCredit">Kyoung Hee Kim</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Kyoung Hee&nbsp;Kim</div> <div class="imageTitle">Microalgae Window Prototype 1</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
