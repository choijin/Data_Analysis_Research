<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Drs. Nicholas Taylor and Kristina Lemmer at Western Michigan University and Daniel Austin at Brigham Young University are working to develop a novel miniaturized instrument for field-portable chemical analysis based on a powerful method known as mass spectrometry. Specifically, the team seeks to develop a device capable of more detailed and yet faster analysis than is currently possible in field-portable analyzers.  The ability to provide industry and the scientific community with a simple, lightweight, and portable tool capable of rapid in situ chemical measurements can have a societal impact on many areas including biochemistry, pharmacology, environmental monitoring, threat detection, industrial monitoring and quality control, as well as planetary exploration. The work is being conducted by undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and aerospace engineering, including members of underrepresented groups.  This cross-disciplinary collaboration resonates with NSF’s goal to enhance convergence research while inspiring and helping train the next generation of scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field portable systems equipped with highly miniaturized ion trap mass analyzers will possess the ability to rapidly and reliably make quantitative chemical measurements of a wide range of molecular species. The novel coaxial ion trap being designed and build by the Taylor team utilizes a rectilinear ion guide (RIG) for efficient injection of internally or externally generated ions into a high capacity simplified toroidal ion trap (STorIT) for ion accumulation and storage. Ions of analytical interest stored in the toroidal trapping region are mass selectively injected into a cylindrical ion trap (CIT) nested within the toroidal trapping ring.  The process of spatially isolating ions for MSn analysis can be repeated for a range of species without having to repopulate the toroidal trapping region, enhancing analytical efficiency. Since a single mass is injected into the CIT for MSn analysis, there is an inherent reduction in chemical noise which enhances the device’s detection limits and identification confidence. The system is being modeled and experimentally evaluated through a collaborative effort between Western Michigan University and Brigham Young University. Three target applications will allow testing of key performance features: rapid analysis of suspected illegal drug powders, sensitive detection of tracer compounds used in natural gas and petroleum wells, and characterization of semi-volatile compounds in atmospheric aerosols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
