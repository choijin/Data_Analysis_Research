<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve the quality of healthcare in the United States by reducing the costs to maintain clinical equipment.  US hospitals spend $93 billion yearly on medical equipment life cycle costs (second only to personnel). Large inefficiencies exist; a typical hospital has 25% over-inventory of equipment, resulting in $1 M annually in unnecessary capital and operational expense.  Current monitoring systems use wireless tags to locate equipment but these do not reduce equipment maintenance costs.  This proposal will develop a new tag with sensors and software to monitor not only equipment location but also utilization and condition to optimize inventory levels. This system will generate further savings by optimizing equipment service intervals based on usage and condition rather than simply elapsed time.  Most importantly, this system will improve patient outcomes by detecting faults requiring immediate service, such as drops and failing mechanical components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance development of technology enabling hospitals to optimally manage clinical equipment.   The solution mounts small battery-powered wireless tags (with sensors and machine learning algorithms) on equipment for monitoring.  The research plan will address three main technical challenges:  applicability, scalability and readiness as follows: 1) Applicability: Measure a wide variety of device types, analyze collected sensor data, identify algorithms mapping sensor data to context, and test performance under real-world scenarios; 2) Scalability: Develop procedures and tools to create an algorithm library for the thousands of device-type/make/models in the hospital market; and 3) Readiness: Characterize the cost-size-battery life trade space, with a goal of tag life of 10 years, including exploring battery alternatives,sensors with deep-sleep modes, and adaptive algorithms maintaining device context with maximum sleep intervals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this Phase 1 SBIR was to develop technology that enables hospitals to significantly increase efficiency and reduce capital and operational expenses related to managing medical equipment.  The solution is based around smart sensing tags and machine learning (ML) algorithms that provide data on the Utilization, Condition, and Location of medical devices in the hospital. This measured data then drives insight and meaningful savings in areas such as: establishing optimal equipment inventory levels, driving efficient equipment workflows, implementing usage-based and condition-based maintenance schedules, and extending asset lifetimes.   The technology is referred to as UCLS - Utilization, Condition, and Location System.    High-level objectives of the Phase 1 SBIR were to address questions of: Applicability, Scalability, and Readiness of UCLS technology.   Applicability referred to proving that the intended approach (sensors mounted on the enclosure of the medical device) could accurately provide Utilization, Condition and Location context information for a variety of medical devices.   Scalability referred to showing an ability to characterize devices and develop algorithms in a scalable way such that it is possible to build up a library of algorithms that works with the thousands of make/models of medical devices in the hospital market.   The Readiness objective referred to exploring real-world product constraints on cost, size, and battery life of the tags.   The research project included: 1) technology studies on key parameters impacting the feasibility of the UCLS technology (tag size, cost, battery life), 2) development of pilot versions of UCLS hardware and software, and 3) several trials of the UCLS pilot solution.  In the course of the SBIR, a new technical task was approved and added:  prototyping and testing of a room-accurate location detector.  Room-accurate location is critical to hospitals, since identifying the room of a device provides a large amount of contextual information on what is happening with the device.  This Phase 1 SBIR was highly successful in addressing all of the high-level objectives.  The research was able to show the approach working with a variety of devices in the lab, and also during a live pilot at a working hospital.  The pilot data was shown to provide meaningful insights.  Key accomplishments included:  developing pilot-ready components (tag with algorithms, server, gateway, smartphone app, and room-accurate location monitor), and running three pilots.  Key technical issues that were successfully addressed, included identification of a core set of sensors, development of a signal-processing framework for a small memory tag device, and development of a multi-sensor measurement application to minimize effort to on-board a new medical device type.  Two patents were filed based on innovations developed during the course of the research.                Last Modified: 05/13/2021       Submitted by: Neil Diener]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
