<AbstractNarration>This project examines the impacts of COVID-19 and states’ and local governments’ social distancing directives on behavior, time spent with others, use of technology, and mental and physical wellbeing. The objective of the project is to investigate these daily life impacts in real time and to analyze how these impacts are affected by sociodemographic characteristics that affect time use and well-being.  Data are leveraged from several hundred respondents’ daily time use before the pandemic along with data collected during and after the pandemic to create a natural experiment that isolates the effects of the pandemic on changes in behavior.  Among the products of this research are evidence-based recommendations to address the social consequences of the pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project collects data for the second and third waves of a three-wave panel study, the second wave during the pandemic with shelter-at-home and lockdown orders in place and the third wave after the pandemic has subsided and orders have been relaxed.  Data for these two waves consist of survey responses and 24-hour time diaries collected from 2,000 respondents from online crowdsourcing platforms.  This sample includes a smaller sample from whom data were collected before the pandemic.  Data are collected on sociodemographics, typical sleep, work, and exercise patterns, and arrangements for housework and carework to investigate effects on time use and wellbeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In March of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, with implications for nearly all aspects of life for individuals around the world, and within the United States. Following this declaration, many jurisdictions within the United States implemented mandates and restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, &ldquo;flatten the curve&rdquo; of infections, and to protect lives. The effects of these mandates and restrictions, which ranged from requirements for wearing a mask and maintaining at least six feet of distance between individuals to the closing of businesses and places where people gather in the name of safety and public health, included extensive damage to local and global economies, political and social unrest exacerbated by other events, and changes to everyday life and functioning that effect mental and physical health in a multitude of ways. An example of this is the closing of many public schools in the United States and a shift from in-person to remote or distance learning, with disproportionate burden for low-income students who may lack access to the tools required for remote learning, and for mothers, especially single mothers, who were suddenly tasked with childcare and education duties. To further document and understand changes to daily life undergone by individuals in the United States at various points throughout the ongoing pandemic, data collection efforts included four waves, each with a survey instrument that included questions from previous waves as well as additional questions that considered specific events, such as a reckoning with racial justice in the United States over the summer of 2020, the presidential election and transfer of power in 2020 and 2021, and vaccination efforts toward the end of the spring of 2021. Additionally, time diaries were collected from participants, and the timing of the data collection efforts allowed for a comparison of time use before and after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic and before, during, and after major social events. This timing of waves of data created an opportunity to deepen understanding of the impact of large-scale changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and important social events for individuals&rsquo; daily experiences and functioning. Subsequent data analysis will evaluate the differential impact of the pandemic by various sociodemographic characteristics, with particular emphasis on sexual minority populations and families. PIs and affiliated researchers will analyze this data for studies motivated by each researchers&rsquo; interest areas. The research team will collaborate on each article, with the goal of producing a number of publications on various topics, utilizing varying methodologies, and contributing extensively to veins of research regarding the social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. To date our results suggest the people's social lives have changed as a result of and throughout the course of the pandemic, including marked changes in wellbeing, satisfaction with social activities, and carework.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Long&nbsp;Doan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
