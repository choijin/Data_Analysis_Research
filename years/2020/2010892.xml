<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. One of the central questions of ecology and evolutionary biology is what limits species’ distributions — given the power of natural selection to produce adaptations to novel environments, why does every species occupy only a small portion of the Earth’s habitat? Related to this, what enables invasive species to rapidly expand their range while many native species have been in the same place for hundreds of generations? The ability of a species to expand its range will be determined by how quickly the environment changes across space and time, and the genetics underlying adaptation to new environments. This research will use experiments, genomics, and modeling to uncover the factors that promote and hinder adaptation of populations expanding across the landscape, while training undergraduates in key research methods and supporting informal, public science education. When the factors limiting species’ distributions are known, it will be possible to better manage invasive species, and more accurately predict how species’ ranges will shift in a changing climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a complementary suite of approaches to elucidate the eco-evolutionary dynamics that promote and hinder adaptation across ecological gradients. First, the fellow will use experimental evolution of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) to test the potentially interactive effects of gradient shape, dispersal potential, and temporal environmental variation on range expansion and adaptation to novel environments. The research will then use population genomic data from this experiment to understand the genetic changes underlying adaptation during range expansion, the genetic mechanisms preventing adaptation at stable range limits, and how gradient type, dispersal, and temporal variation influence range dynamics through population genetic effects. Finally, a novel individual-based simulation model will be built, parameterized with the experimental data, and extends recent range limit models by including temporal variation in selective environments. The fellow will recruit undergraduate students through the Wyoming Research Scholars Program, focusing on groups underrepresented in STEM fields, and mentor these students through the proposed research and support of individual projects. Outside the university, the fellow will bring engaging biology lessons to informal, public venues. Upon completion of this fellowship the fellow will have extensive, complementary experience in a range of theoretical, empirical, and genomics approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
