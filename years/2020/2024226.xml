<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an AI (artificial intelligence) solution that is aimed at enhancing student active learning. This technology platform is aimed at providing dynamic assessments of student performance throughout the academic year. The AI technology triggers timely interventions by providing early detection of struggling students as well as students with special talents. Unlike traditional platforms, this solution uses a combination of factors such as students’ behavior in the classroom, homework grades ,and regular test scores to evaluate risk levels and recommends generalized and personalized feedback plus identified routines for improving student learning performance. The platform also will communicate students’ progress to students/parents/teachers regularly. The proposed technology may enhance the learning experience by taking an approach that excludes the flaws of current system surfaced by the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of an AI (artificial intelligence) solution that uses advanced analytics to enhance students' learning performance. The proposed technology uses a a combination of AI tools such as computer vision, deep learning, machine learning, and natural language processing to thoroughly analyze students’ behavior inside and outside the classroom. It provides important prescriptive analytics and uses recommendation systems and collaborative filtering to provide dynamic feedback and identifies successful routines for improving the student learning performance. This project is based on several behavior data science studies and the power of advanced analytics for generating data-driven insights in education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
