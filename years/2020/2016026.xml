<AbstractNarration>The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international organization for computational linguistics and natural language processing. This is one of the primary application areas for researchers in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The proceedings of the ACL's annual meeting provide the foundation of the field; it is the most cited and most respected publication in computational linguistics. Thus, it is also the most important gathering of researchers in computational linguistics and natural language processing, and represents one of the most important opportunities for young researchers to understand the field, build professional connections, and gain exposure. ACL has a twenty-one-year history of supporting these formative activities by holding a student research workshop. The workshops have proven popular: attracting dozens of submissions from highly qualified applicants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student research workshop will be a part of the  2020 Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), to be held in conjunction with the main conference July 5th –July 10th, 2020. This year ACL  will be held online due to COVID-19 and the workshop will subsidize only conference registration for students who are selected to participate. The workshop will solicit submissions in two categories: (1) *thesis proposals* for advanced students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to receive feedback and (2) *research papers* describing completed work or work in progress with significant preliminary results. Each accepted paper will be assigned an established research mentor who will meet with the student during the conference to provide individual feedback. Both paper types will be presented in the poster session of the main conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Student Research Workshop was held in conjunction with ACL 2020. The SRW gives student researchers in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing the opportunity to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentorship by experienced members in ACL community.  Website  We created a website, the primary source of information about the SRW: https://sites.google.com/view/acl20studentresearchworkshop/.  Additionally, we managed a Twitter account for posting updates to social media: (@acl_srw).  The call for papers was publicized through the ACL mailing list as well as the ACL 2020 Twitter account (@acl_meeting). Mentoring Programs  We offered two mentoring programs this year. Pre-submission mentoring was available to all authors who wanted feedback before submitting their papers to the SRW. Post-acceptance mentoring program was available to authors of accepted papers, to get feedback on their camera-ready drafts and their conference presentations. Pre-submission mentoring  We followed last year’s SRW in offering an optional round of pre-submission mentoring. Authors who submitted their papers in time for the pre-submission deadline received feedback from their assigned mentors before the final submission deadline, giving them time to integrate the mentor’s feedback into their final submission. A total of 57 papers participated in the pre-submission mentoring program. We recruited 30 mentors, all of whom are well-experienced researchers in the field, for the pre-submission program.  Papers were matched to mentors based on research areas. The mentoring feedback was sent to authors anonymously through the SRW organizers. Additionally, the majority of mentors also offered to participate in follow-up discussions with the authors directly via email until the main submission deadline. Post-acceptance mentoring  Each accepted paper was assigned a post-acceptance mentor, to provide feedback to the authors about their camera-ready drafts and conference presentations (which were pre-recorded this year). 49 mentors were recruited, i.e., one for each accepted paper. Grammarly Premium  During both the pre-submission and post-acceptance mentoring programs, writing assistance in the form of vouchers for one month's free use of Grammarly Premium was sent to all participating authors. These were provided by the ACL 2020 Diversity and Inclusion Committee. Submission and Reviewing Submission procedure  The SRW consisted of two submission tracks: research papers and thesis proposals. Research papers were intended to encompass completed work, as well as works-in-progress from graduate students, masters students, and advanced undergraduates. Thesis proposals were intended to be a venue for senior graduate students to get feedback on their thesis proposal and the broader ideas surrounding the appropriateness and impact of their chosen topic.   Submissions were managed through the START conference system. Number of submissions  We received 137 submissions in total: 10 thesis proposals and 127 research papers. Among these, 12 research papers were non-archival.  The SRW received submissions from students in 28 countries, with the majority of submissions coming from the United States, China, India, and Japan.  We accepted 49 papers, with an acceptance rate of 36%. After withdrawals and excluding non-archival papers, 42 papers appear in the SRW proceedings, including 6 thesis proposals and 36 research papers.  Because of changes in conference deadlines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, several authors requested a change from the non-archival to archival track.   All accepted papers (archival and non-archival) were presented at the conference. Program committee  We were fortunate to recruit 262 members for the SRW Program Committee. Each paper was assigned 3 reviewers. No reviewer was assigned more than 2 papers. Reviewing  We based the review form on the ACL 2020 format, removing the questions about presentation type and best paper award: https://acl2020.org/_pages/docs/ACL_2020_Submission_Form.pdf Virtual Conference  The SRW papers are presented in conjunction with other ACL main conference papers from July 6 to July 8. All the papers accepted to the SRW i.e., research papers and thesis proposals in both the archival and non-archival tracks, were presented at the conference.  For the virtual presentations, we adopted the same format as the main conference, which featured pre-recorded talks, live Q&amp;A sessions, and online messaging channels.  The SRW is traditionally held as a poster session at the same time and venue as that of the main conference. In coordination with the ACL Program Chairs, the Virtual Infrastructure Chairs, and the Publication Chairs, the SRW was conducted as a track within the main virtual conference:  The virtual ACL website had the SRW papers in a separate track, listed alongside those of the main conference and system demonstrations. The live Q&amp;A sessions for SRW papers were in the same time slots as the papers of the main conference. The schedule for the main conference included SRW papers.   SlidesLive was used to host the pre-recorded presentations. Authors were required to record a 12 minute video for each paper.  Each paper was assigned two one-hour live Q&amp;A sessions. Since the authors are located in different time zones, we conducted a survey about their available time slots, and tried to schedule the Q&amp;A sessions according to their preferences.
