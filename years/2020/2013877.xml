<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address an unmet need in incomplete colonoscopy procedures, as they can result in missed colorectal cancer and ultimately increase healthcare expenditures related to follow-up procedures, with an estimated $1 B in the colonoscopy market. The proposed device will transition over 15% of colonoscopies today that are incomplete to fully screened procedures at a fraction of the cost of a colonoscopy.  This proposed approach offers an entirely new manner for completing incomplete procedures to minimize costs, while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of an integrated balloon overtube that can be used intraoperatively as a mid-procedure, time-efficient addition on the endoscope.  Current balloon overtubes are used only in challenging conditions, due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient application, but their use during colonoscopy can significantly improve cecal intubation rates and overall outcomes.  The proposed advanced balloon overtube directly addresses the need to maximize complete colonoscopies. This project will advance the development of an intraoperative tool for endoscopists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this project was to demonstrate feasibility of an integrated balloon overtube that can be used intraoperatively as a mid-procedure, time-efficient addition on the endoscope. Current balloon overtubes are generally used only in challenging conditions, due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient application, but their use during colonoscopy can significantly improve cecal intubation rates and overall outcomes. This project’s advanced balloon overtube directly addressed the need to maximize complete colonoscopies.  The broader impact and commercial potential of this project was to address an unmet need in incomplete colonoscopy procedures, as they can result in missed colorectal cancer and ultimately increase healthcare expenditures related to follow-up procedures, with an estimated $1B in the colonoscopy market. The project addressed an unmet need of providing endoscopists with an intraoperative tool that can transition over 15% of colonoscopies today that are incomplete, to fully screened procedures at a fraction of the cost of a colonoscopy.  This approach offers an entirely new manner for completing incomplete procedures to minimize costs, while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experience.  In summary, the project technology and customer discovery results have positioned the team to move the technology from bench to bedside to bring this product to physicians to improve patient outcomes.
