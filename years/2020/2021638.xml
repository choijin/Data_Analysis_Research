<AbstractNarration>PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crystalline materials play many important roles in society ranging from medicine to energy storage, and waste remediation to sustainability.  The development of new materials to meet 21st Century needs requires the contribution of scientists with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, physics, materials science, computer science and engineering.  The Gordon Research Conference on Crystal Engineering (GRC-CE) will bring together leading and emerging scientists in the crystal engineering field where the presentation and discussion of the latest research can serve to both define and align with the materials challenges of the future.  The conference format is designed to encourage significant interactions between established and younger participants, which is critical to facilitating the open exchange of ideas, stimulating collaboration, and developing the next generation of talent.  With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry and Condensed Matter Physics programs within the Division of Materials Research, registration fee and/or travel support will be provided for younger participants, including students, postdoctoral associates and junior faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge and understanding in crystal engineering is needed to develop the advanced materials needs of the 21st century.  The 2020 GRC-CE, themed “Inspired Design, Assembly and Properties of Molecular Materials,” will highlight the breadth of the crystal engineering field as it spans fundamental topics of crystal design and assembly to opportunities for commercialization.  The conference program includes leading experts who bring a variety of perspectives (e.g. academia, national laboratories and industry) to encourage new multidisciplinary ways of thinking across scientific fields.  As with past GRC-CEs, ensuring diversity will be a top priority, particularly with respect to the inclusion of women and other underrepresented groups.  The associated Gordon Research Seminar, themed “Engineering Crystals in the Fourth Dimension: Monitoring of Structural Changes in Crystals,” provides a forum for graduate students, post-doctoral associates, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education to present their results and engage in meaningful scientific discussions and professional development.  With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry and Condensed Matter Physics programs within the Division of Materials Research, the GRC-CE will gather leading experts in the major and emerging areas of crystal engineering.  A high level of interaction among established scientists and the next generation of researchers will help to enhance the exchange of ideas within the crystal engineering community and to develop the next generation of talent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
