<AbstractNarration>Responses to the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) have led to a substantial number of employees working from home in an ad-hoc emergency fashion. This project examines the ramifications of temporary work-from-home environments for organizational cybersecurity. The project team is assessing organizational methods used to help secure temporary remote locations, examining the new workplace characteristics that employees encounter, and determining whether and how these factors influence the security of sensitive organizational data, information, and digital systems.  Project findings will allow the research team to develop actionable recommendations to organizational leaders who rely on temporary, remote work locations for their employees in times of substantial uncertainty.  This project will help guide the design and implementation of organizational cybersecurity policies, procedures, and other efforts relied upon during significant future crises—times when cybersecurity threats tend to be elevated and employees dispersed throughout numerous locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team is using a mixed methods approach to evaluate possible responses by employees to the unexpected work conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. These employees might exhibit increased resilience to cybersecurity risks due to the cooperative motivations that often follow disasters. On the other hand, stressors associated with working at home might lead employees to pay less attention to cybersecurity demands and to engage in shortcuts and workarounds. Thus, the project investigates the extent that organizational responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis lead individuals to protect their environments and their organizations from cybersecurity threats or by contrast to engage in behavior that constitutes threats to sensitive organizational assets and practices. In-depth semi-structured interviews and experience sampling assessments are performed using several samples of employees working at home.  Daily surveys will be completed by a sample of participants over a two-week period to determine fluctuations in employee attitudes, emotions, and behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The COVID-19 pandemic forced many employees to work from temporary, home-based environments.  Not only did this shift from traditional office environments to remote work locations occur suddenly for most employees, it created circumstances wherein employees had to alter their homes for work activities while simultaneously being concerned about their and their loved ones’ health.  Many organizations were also ill-prepared to handle these changes as leaders grappled with threats to operational effectiveness and cybersecurity with so many employees working on sensitive tasks and systems from makeshift offices. This project examined these personal and environmental alterations to daily work and how they influenced important outcomes like employee work stress, productivity, absentmindedness, and overall compliance with cybersecurity protocols and policies.  From the extensive qualitative and quantitative datasets produced from the project, several important patterns and/or relationships were uncovered.  Importantly, while employees adhered to their organizations’ cybersecurity policies 95% of the time, 66% deviated from cyber policy during a longitudinal study.  The project also discovered that during the days employees had at least one task wherein they failed to comply with cybersecurity policies, they failed to comply in one out of every five work tasks on average.  Counter to the prevailing notion that such behavior results largely from employees retaliating due to perceived injustices or who desire to create harm or are unstable, the project revealed that the overwhelming reason for nonadherence was that employees needed to obtain something to complete their daily tasks, and cybersecurity policies impeded those needs.  Thus, the demands placed on employees by organizational cybersecurity policies and procedures&mdash;at least during the COVID-19 pandemic&mdash;were in fact the root cause for most insider-initiated breaches of protocol.  Further, theories used to understand why employees fail to adhere to cyber requirements must account for how those demands impact the flow of daily work tasks.  The project supported two minority Ph.D. students who gained experience in conducting mixed-methods and longitudinal research.  Given their backgrounds in Industrial Organizational Psychology, these students can continue to make contributions to cybersecurity via human-centric approaches, thereby complementing the technical focus to cyber in the hopes of providing more holistic solutions for our nation. The team delivered multiple presentations to regional and national professional cybersecurity organizations throughout the U.S. These presentations directly reached individuals responsible for the protection of critical data and information assets within their organizations, who we advised on the importance of examining and addressing stressors as barriers to cybersecurity adherence.
