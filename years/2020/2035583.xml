<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences and workshops that seek to increase the research and education capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and faculty at HBCUs. Morgan State University will organize a student symposium held in conjunction with the 92nd National Technical Association (NTA) Annual Conference to be held on September 23-26, 2020, hosted virtually by Clark Atlanta University. Undergraduate students from HBCUs will virtually participate in the one-day student symposium to present their research and build a network of support by interacting with faculty and industry representatives, as well as fully participate in the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NTA, established in 1926, promotes the involvement of undergraduate students in scientific and technical research activities. The symposium sessions will provide a culminating experience for approximately one hundred students to disseminate research results to peers and professionals attending the NTA conference through oral and poster sessions. Students will have a chance to enhance their communication skills and receive critical feedback related to their academic work and potential careers. A key objective is to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to network with scientists and engineers from academia, industry, government agencies, and the private sector. Although the COVID19 virus is a high priority topic, preparing and growing the future STEM workforce is  at the core of the NTA mission and the agenda will also include topics in the geosciences, as well as topics in big data, artificial  intelligence, robotics, and other emerging technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Each session awarded the top three presenters and only one award for the special session since it had only five presenters.   A total of 60 students and 20 faculty members registered for the student symposium from over 20 institutions from the nation’s HBCUs. Overall, the symposium was able to give underrepresented minority students the platform for presentation of their research findings: 1. Students were given an opportunity they otherwise may not have to present their research to a national audience; 2. Students gained confidence in their scientific communication skills; 3. Students were able to network with other peers and professionals; 4. Students were able to use the online platform for their presentations.   The number of HBCUs represented at the conference was twenty.  It is though a good number, but we would like to aim to have more HBCUs participate in the future years. A stronger effort will be put in place to recruit all HBCUs.  Due to the virtual nature of the conferences, the personal interaction aspect was lacking throughout.  Hope the pandemic situation will get better that more in-person conference can be conducted.        Last Modified: 08/04/2021       Submitted by: Hongtao Yu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
