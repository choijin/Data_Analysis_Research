<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable broad use of inorganic micro light emitting diode (microLEDs) in displays through a new manufacturing process.  MicroLEDs are used for ultra-high resolution vivid displays for many consumer electronics applications ranging from hand-held devices to large area displays, but they require low power consumption. The proposed technology will be used to facilitate processes in which the picking and movement of parts that are micron-sized (one-tenth the thickness of a human hair) are advanced through a manufacturing system. It will have the ability to scale to various display form factors and microLED sizes, offering a significant cost advantage and new manufacturing flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project develops a two-stage process and micro-transfer head (PSETH) technology for the selective massive parallel transfer of microLEDs from native substrate to a display matrix.  The PSETH is enclosed by a film of high magnetic permeability material and is mounted on an electromagnet to hold microsLEDs and features patterned elements of the same size and layout structure as the desired plurality to be transferred. It detaches them from the native substrate using a selective wet etch process, and then picks and transfers only the selected plurality of microLEDs.  The proposed project will advance the technology for use at scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF STTR Phase-I award was used to build a prototype for the main equipment module to demonstrate the massive parallel transfer technology of micron-size objects based on LuxNour?s patented electromagnetic pattern-sensitive head (PSH). This is a ?game changing? technology which enables the wide-spread commercialization of displays based on inorganic micro-LED (light emitting diodes). Because of their superior luminance efficiency, compared to rival organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, inorganic micro-LED (mLED) displays are expected to become the next self-emissive display technology. The mLED display employs arrays of microscopic LEDs to comprise the display?s individual pixel elements. Compared to conventional liquid crystal displays (LCD), mLED displays can deliver superior contrast, faster response time and reduced energy consumption. The most developed approach to the fabrication of mLED displays requires transferring mLEDs emitting the three basic color (Red, Blue &amp; Green) from the three different native substrates, on which these were fabricated, onto a display panel or matrix that carries the electronic circuitry required to drive theses mLEDs. Since these mLEDs are in the few micrometer size range, the task of selectively transferring a plurality of these devices is a challenging problem.</p> <p>We designed, fabricated and demonstrated the performance of 4? x 4? PSH on 6? silicon wafer, featuring a 30 mm thick sheath of nickel (high permeability magnetic material) in which discontinuities were introduced according to the layout and size of the micro-objects to be transferred. The prototype featured a PSH assembly (electromagnet, PSH holding plate and the PSH itself) mounted on an automated Z-axis motion mechanism. The donor &amp; receiving substrates were placed on a 6- degrees of freedom stage to allow for the accurate placement and alignment of the PSH and the micro-objects. As a donor substrate resembling micro LEDs (mLEDs), we utilized 15 mm wide dummy structures, fabricated on 6 inch silicon substrate, distributed on a grid of 7.5 mm spacing. These structures were electroplated with thin nickel layer to enable the use of a magnetic field in the transfer process. The PSH functionality was demonstrated by its ability to collect a plurality of micro-objects to the specific location and layout of discontinuities on the PSH surface. The PSH-based transfer exhibited high tolerance to fabrication defects of the PSH itself, the gap to the objects to be picked, and to misalignment between it and these objects.</p> <p>Beyond achieving the technical goals set for this project, a key discovery, which directly impacts our future equipment design and commercialization plan was unveiled. Contrary to our original transfer process, we discovered that the wet etch bulk transfer phase requires the use of a separate PSH of the same layout as the donor substrate. To present our customers with a complete Micro-LED transfer solution, we must ensure the availability of a wet etch equipment with integrated PSH. The intellectual property production of this project is represented by one filed patent (USPTO Application # 17234693 filed 04/19/2021) and another application in the preparation stage.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2021<br>      Modified by: Makarem&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hussein</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655359565_prototype--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655359565_prototype--rgov-800width.jpg" title="prototype"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655359565_prototype--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="prototype"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">none</div> <div class="imageCredit">luxnour</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Makarem&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hussein</div> <div class="imageTitle">prototype</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655392136_PSH2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655392136_PSH2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="PSH"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655392136_PSH2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="PSH"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">none</div> <div class="imageCredit">Luxnour</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Makarem&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hussein</div> <div class="imageTitle">PSH</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655538168_mLEDmatrix--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655538168_mLEDmatrix--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Micro-object matrix"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655538168_mLEDmatrix--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Micro-object matrix"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">none</div> <div class="imageCredit">Luxnour</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Makarem&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hussein</div> <div class="imageTitle">Micro-object matrix</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655596795_pickedobjects--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655596795_pickedobjects--rgov-800width.jpg" title="PSH functionality"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2025881/2025881_10692521_1627655596795_pickedobjects--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="PSH functionality"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">none</div> <div class="imageCredit">Luxnour</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Makarem&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hussein</div> <div class="imageTitle">PSH functionality</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
