<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to generate an integrated model analyzing biogeophysical and socioeconomic processes and responses to environmental transformation.  Natural disasters have incurred direct damages costing an estimated $18 B a year, and the average net benefit of investing in more resilient infrastructure is $4.2 T.   Proactive adaptation can significantly reduce both the direct and indirect costs associated with climate hazards and natural disasters, protecting people, homes, lifestyles and businesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses risk management associated with environmental transformation, bridging the biophysical and social sciences and informed by real-time observations. The project aims to provide a first proof-of-concept of an advanced model representing a range of integrated environmental risks, such as erosion, flooding, food security, etc. The research and development effort will focus on: 1) Integrating biophysical sensitivities to to produce risk factors for hazards of concern; 2) Including community engagement to identify which biophysical sensitivities translate to socioecological vulnerabilities or opportunities; and 3) Identifying outcomes of the socioeconomic vulnerability assessments and scenarios. The envisioned proof-of-concept is a cost-effective, data-driven solution for proactive management of environmental transformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The ICARIS is adaptive, comparing the ability of potential management strategies to reduce risks; the benefits associated with each action can be evaluated separately and cumulatively, as well as the success of each action. For example, did the action reduce the magnitude and timing of the targeted climate hazard to the degree expected? Were conditions improved to a level greater than baseline, if that was the expectation? ICARIS is a living document, changing as community objectives shift and as new data is available. It is an interactive process to bring stakeholders together, and to increase the understanding of climate risks and hazards, generate discussion, and develop a plan forward to increase community resilience. The villages cannot reduce the probability of a flood event, but they can reduce the flood?s impact by raising homes above the expected flood levels. Not only does the ICARIS support comparisons between potential options, but it is also a quick visual to demonstrate what processes are being impacted between communities, enabling between-community comparisons.
