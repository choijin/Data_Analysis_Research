<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is to increase performance and simplify the development of electric motors. This project develops additive manufacturing technology for the electromagnetic and electronic components necessary for new high-performance motors for applications such as commercial aviation. The global electric motor market was estimated at $100 B in 2017. The proposed technology allows more efficient utilization of rare earth materials, and could eliminate the conventional trade-offs between motor efficiency and cost, enabling reduced energy intensity by cost-driven applications, like heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), to significantly reduce their energy intensity.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed SBIR Phase I project will explore translation of a novel manufacturing process allowing printing of high-density wire windings with the same design freedom and streamlined manufacturing associated with printed circuit boards today.  Because the upstream wire manufacturing and coating processes have such tight tolerances, a relatively modest plotting machine can produce electromagnetic devices at speeds of several meters per second.  Further, by incorporating electronics directly into the plotted windings, devices which would conventionally require integrating multiple manufacturing processes can be made in a single step.  In this project, we will advance the development of an end-to-end workflow for this manufacturing process and use it to prototype a novel high-performance electric motor design.  Gravimetric power densities of over 20 kW/kg may be possible with this approach, representing a 4X improvement over state-of-the-art in the 100kW class and potentially enabling electric aviation.  In this project, we will advance and validate the performance of a new motor prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This SBIR Phase I project developed a low-cost additive manufacturing platform enabling printing of high-density wire windings with the same design freedom and streamlined manufacturing associated with printed circuit boards. Because the upstream wire manufacturing and coating processes have such tight tolerances, a low cost plotting machine can produce electromagnetic devices at high speeds with high copper density. Further, by incorporating electronics directly into the plotted windings, devices which would conventionally require multiple manufacturing processes can be made in a single step, and previously unattainable component geometries can be realized.  This ability to print a wide range of devices directly from digital files opens new opportunities in electromagnetics, including the use of computer-aided simulation and design.    As part of the award development cycle, a dedicated machine platform was developed which attained repeatability below 10 microns, speeds above 200mm/s, and a bill of materials below $5,000.  This machine platform was then used to develop a laser-assisted printhead for three-dimensional printing, enabling novel winding geometries.  To efficiently incorporate drive electronics, a laser insulation stripping capability was developed, and integration with printed circuit board pads was demonstrated. The machine platform and these capabilities were then used to prototype a brushless axial flux motor, using a nonstandard, power-dense stator winding.    Simultaneous to this technical development, commercial targets were evaluated.  The efficiency gains and the consequent savings in system costs for battery electric vehicles were analysed, demonstrating that motor and controller topologies achievable with this technology could reduce required battery capacity in modeled electric vehicles by 10-20%.  Beyond the electric motor target application, potential gains in solid state transformers were analyzed, where an even larger commercial impact was discovered, as novel winding designs enabled by this technology were projected to significantly decrease resistance at the operating frequencies.  The potential commercial impact of this application is large, as such power conversion technology enables electric grid expansion within the constraints of the built environment, while also increasing resilience and security.
