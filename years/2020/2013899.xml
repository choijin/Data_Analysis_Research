<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commerical potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a potentially significant reduction in medication-related falls, injuries, and deaths, as well as a reduction in fall-related medical costs.  The number of older adults dying from falls increased by a factor of three between 2000 and 2016, with increased medication use possibly contributing to this alarming trend.   Polypharmacy (i.e., taking 4 or more drugs) is growing with a 3-fold increase from 1992 to 2002.  Since drugs are a modifiable risk factor, periodic medication reviews are recommended for fall prevention.   This project will explore a new balance test involving target tracking to remotely monitor medication fall risk and allowing for timelier, personalized assessment of the risk of getting hurt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a new balance test using target tracking. Technical work includes: 1) Confirm that the new test is sensitive to medication effects and is safe to perform; 2) Discriminate between fallers and non-fallers, thus demonstrating test validity; and 3) Compare test results with those of other tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In November 2020, Sumaq Life completed the NSF Beat-the-Odds Bootcamp. Interviews conducted during the Bootcamp disproved a key hypothesis related to Sumaq Life's business thesis. Earlier interviews completed during an NIH I-Corps program in 2018 revealed that physician reimbursement for using Sumaq Life's fall risk assessment technology would be important for clinical adoption.  Interviews with remote patient monitoring service providers also suggested that Sumaq Life's technology would be covered using new remote patient monitoring codes, which was critical to the business thesis.  However, follow-up interviews with service providers during the Bootcamp indicated that these new codes were only applicable to a small number of clinical measures, and did not include assessing fall risk.  As these codes were new, there was uncertainty regarding what type of patient monitoring would be covered.  Without physician reimbursement, clinical adoption of Sumaq Life's technology for monitoring medication fall risk was not likely to occur.  As a result, Sumaq Life began investigating new market opportunities.  Unfortunately, a viable market opportunity could not be found.    Given that a viable market opportunity could not be identified, Sumaq Life decided to forgo a no-cost extension for the STTR project and proceeded to close-out the STTR Phase I award.  Once Sumaq Life realized that its business thesis was invalidated, development work on its technology and research related to the original scope of work was suspended.  Less than 20% of the approved budget was spent on the STTR Phase I award.            Last Modified: 08/16/2021       Submitted by: Norman P Reeves]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
