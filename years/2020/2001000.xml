<AbstractNarration>Numbers are often used in important decisions about health and wealth (e.g., mortgages, health insurance, credit card debt, medical treatment options). Policy makers and others generally assume that if you provide the appropriate numbers, people will understand and use them. Previous research, however, has shown that individuals differ in how well they understand and use numbers and how much they rely on different sources of information in decision making. Individuals lower vs. higher in objective numeracy (numeric literacy) comprehend less and generally make poorer decisions when numbers are involved. This research has largely ignored two other numeric competencies: subjective numeracy and approximate number sense. In this project, the Principal Investigator will test how each of the three numeric competencies is related to decision processes and whether enhancing two of the competencies (objective numeracy and subjective numeracy) can subsequently improve judgments and choices.  This research will lead to better interventions to improve decision making about health and wealth.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In eleven studies, the Principal Investigator will test correlational and/or causal impacts of the numeric competencies on ten decision processes identified as important to judgments and choices. The results will enhance our understanding of the correlational and causal roles of multiple numeric competencies in judgments and decisions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Numerical information is common in decisions (e.g., mortgages, health insurance, credit card debt, medical treatment options). Policy makers and others generally assume that if you provide the appropriate numbers, people will understand and use them. Previous research, however, has shown that people with better and worse math skills (those who are lower and higher in numeracy) rely on different sources of information in decisions. In particular, those lower in numeracy comprehend less and often make poorer decisions when numbers are involved (Frederick, 2005; Peters et al., 2006; Schwartz et al., 1997). Numeracy research, however, has been largely correlational in nature (with other measures of general intelligence sometimes used as control variables) and it's sometimes unclear whether numeracy, or another variable like intelligence caused some effect. Few attempts exist to examine numeracy's causal impact in decision processes and outcomes. The current and expected findings test this causal link and draw theory-based bridges between mathematics education and judgment and decision making. In addition, research highlights the multiple numeric competencies that matter to judgments and decisions. A further impact on the field is understanding the situational factors that lead less numerate decision makers to make worse judgments or decisions and, critically, that appear to lead highly numerate decision makers to make arguably worse judgments and decisions.</p> <p>The present research tested and furthered understanding of the detailed psychological mechanisms linked with the different numeric competencies. We expected and found that objective numeracy relates to greater efficiency in processing numbers and a tendency to derive integral affective meaning from numeric information (i.e., good/bad feelings about the numbers). It relates to and causes an ability/willingness to perform numeric operations (e.g., comparing numbers, calculating expected value, having consistent risk judgments), consistency in risk perceptions, and memory for numeric information. These objective-numeracy-related inclinations to compare numbers, such as incomes, relate to satisfaction with one's income and life. Subjective numeracy and especially its subscale of numeric self-efficacy, on the other hand, relates to and may cause positive vs. negative incidental emotional reactions to the presence of numbers in decisions, better vs. worse moods following completion of a math task (vs. a verbal task), confidence and/or motivation in using numbers, and perseverance in numeric tasks. Finally, the acuity of the approximate number system was expected and found to relate to better recall of numeric information and more willingness to delay rewards to get a larger reward. Our studies generally have provided supportive evidence for these hypotheses.</p> <p>In survey and experimental studies of health and financial outcomes, we have further found that both objective numeracy and numeric self-efficacy matter, and they interact. Specifically, those high in both numeracy and numeric efficacy have the best outcomes, while those with a "mismatch"--high in one and low in the other--have worse outcomes.
