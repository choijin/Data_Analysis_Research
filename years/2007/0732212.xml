<AbstractNarration>The proposed study is an effort to bring the Problem-Solving Cycle model of mathematics professional development to scale by fostering the facilitation skills of middle school mathematics instructional leaders (ILs). The study includes 2½ years of preparation and support for all the ILs within a large urban school district with a substantial minority student enrollment. These ILs will implement the PSC with the mathematics teachers in their schools. Researchers will analyze the preparation and support that ILs need, the quality of their implementation, and the impact of the PD process on ILs, teachers, and students.</AbstractNarration>
