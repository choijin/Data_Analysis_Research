<AbstractNarration>This research program seeks to study how standards recommendations regarding a student-centered approach to mathematics instruction can be actualized so that systematic investigations of its impact on students? learning can be carried out. I propose (1) sensitizing studies: to understand the contexts in which mathematics faculty in community colleges teach; and (2) probing studies: to test conditions under which teaching strategies designed to influence planning, classroom interaction, and verification practices affect instruction. I use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. This work will develop our understanding of artifacts in teaching, how planning is affected and how classroom interaction can be changed in undergraduate classrooms. The results will highlight the critical conditions under which mathematics is delivered in community colleges and contribute to raise awareness of the need to support them as they strive to improve their practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This program of research had two major research goals:  to understand the contexts in which mathematics faculty in community colleges teach; and  to test conditions under which teaching strategies designed to influence planning, classroom interaction, and verification practices affect instruction.   I collected a large corpus of data that includes in-depth interviews with faculty (~55), students (~12), and administrators (~5); classroom observations (~33); surveys of studentsÆ knowledge of algebra and trigonometry in three courses (~100); surveys of students regarding their goal orientations to learning (~800); focus groups (~10) discussing three trigonometry animations; examples in college algebra textbooks (~500); and responses to an on-line program of instructional analysis (~18 instructors). The investigations that resulted from this work addressed four major areas:  Characterization of instruction in mathematics classrooms at community colleges.  Rationale for instructional decision making StudentsÆ goal orientations Characterization of examples in college algebra textbooks.   Characterization of instruction in mathematics classrooms at community colleges. I identified the interactions that occur between teachers, students, and mathematical content, in community college mathematics classrooms. The grant included pre-college, non-developmental courses: College Algebra, Trigonometry, and Pre-Calculus. These descriptions were the first to be produced for mathematics. The interactions are characterized by questions and answers; both instructors and students ask many questions during any given session; in general these questions are related to the mathematical content at stake. The teacher is always responsible for the content organization, presentation, and evaluation. These behaviors are regulated by norms that are very specific to the context of these pre-college courses. Specifically:  instructors present the material in the form of examples that illustrate the content.   The presentation of the content follows a pre-established plan determined by the departmental syllabus of the course and supported by the textbook.   Students ask or answer fewer questions in trigonometry courses than in lower-level courses.  Students rarely collaborate with one another or in groups, although some instructors like using this form of interaction.  Graphing calculators are available all the time and students use them heavily.  Instructors rarely ask questions regarding the plausibility or correctness of a response or a final solution to a problem;  Instructors engage the students by asking questions about how to apply known procedures rather than asking them to decide what procedure to apply; and  Instructors offer as examples problems that contain all the information needed to produce only one solution.   Rationale for instructional decision-making. In justifying specific actions in the classrooms faculty attend to various obligations, towards the institution, the discipline, the group of students, and their individual students. More prominently, faculty respond to obligations towards students. In addition, full-time and part-time faculty respond to similar obligations. However, part-time faculty tend to use more tentative language, which suggest a weaker sense of autonomy in their work.  Characterization of examples in college algebra textbooks. Examples used in college algebra textbooks used in four- and two-year institutions tend to be of low cognitive demand, emphasize symbolic and numeric representations, ask for a single response without elaboration, and avoid asking for ways to verify that the answer is correct. Even in textbook sections in which the cognitive demand can be high, or when multiple representations, especially graphical representation, is useful, the textbooks tend not use those. Moreover, there are no differences along these dimensions for textbooks used in four-year institutions or those used in two-year institution...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
