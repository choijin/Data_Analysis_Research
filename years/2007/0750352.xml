<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II Project combines 3-D computer graphics and gaming technology to provide a non-linear, immersive learning environment for science education in the human anatomy and physiology domain. Modern computer-simulations present a unique ability to present scientific information in an easy to understand manner. Technology advances in computer graphics present opportunities to present higher quality visual models in an interactive fashion that can convey the scientific process in a way which makes learning science fun and interesting for the students while capturing their enthusiasm for science. The proposed project will develop a toolkit consisting of 3-D visualizations for teaching human anatomy and physiology and interactive simulation environments for exploring the human body from a first person point of view. It is envisioned that simulations will be used in conjunction with traditional lectures while the interactive environments will provide immersive reinforcement learning. Phase II development will be validated by an independent evaluation that measures the products effects on achievement and interest in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will play a role in increasing achievement and interest in science. In order for the nation to remain competitive in the life sciences, the nation must produce an adequate number of students who pursue  degrees in life sciences.  The proposed research is targeted at improving students' interest and achievement in science, and thus greatly impact the disturbing drop in recent years in United States' student interest in pursuing science education and careers, and the rapid increase in demand in the labor market for science-based degrees for the labor market.</AbstractNarration>
