<AbstractNarration>The centerpiece of this project is a daily audio podcast-young, snappy, and fresh with the African-American experience prominent in its multicultural orientation.  These will be linked to bi-weekly video podcasts in the format of teleconferences.  These will explore in depth key scientific developments with panelists made up of researchers, emerging scientists and the general public.  The target audience is 18-30 year old minorities.   3rd Rock Reality will be produced in cooperation with Howard and Clark Atlanta Universities that will provide leadership for a broad consortium of institutions linked to the project which will identify emerging topics and scientists, and provide additional dissemination and outreach.  Additional collaborating institutions include Woods Hole Research Center, Boston College, Hunter College, Harvard University and Yale University.  RMC Research Corporation will conduct the evaluation</AbstractNarration>
