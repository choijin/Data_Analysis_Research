<AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DRL 07-41644&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  WGBH Educational Foundation&lt;br/&gt;PI:   Kate Taylor&lt;br/&gt;Title of Project: Peep and the Big Wide World "Anywhere Math" Season 4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WGBH Educational Foundation will produce and distribute 10 new episodes of the award-winning TV series PEEP and the Big Wide World, launching a new initiative "Anywhere Math".  In addition, funds will help launch an expanded PEEP Web site, and develop and evaluate an outreach plan targeted to Native American preschoolers.   PEEP's three intended impacts are to (1) engage preschoolers in science explorations that promote positive attitudes and inquiry skills, (2) empower parents to encourage and support their children's science activities and promote the ideas of "science play", and (3) provide educational resources and professional development for preschool educators via a curriculum that contributes to the emerging field of preschool science and math education.  Project partners include Head Start, Science Olympiad, Countdown to Kindergarten, and the Boston Children's Museum.  The series is produced by WGBH and broadcast on TLC and Discovery Kids. This upcoming season the show will also be broadcast on public television via APT. Goodman Research Group will conduct formative and summative evaluations to assess project impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ WGBH Educational Foundation  "Peep and the Big Wide World" Season IV   Project Outcomes Report  With this project grant for "Peep and the Big Wide World" Season IV, we were able to achieve several significant accomplishments, including: broadening the Peep curriculum to include "Anywhere Math;" producing six new Peep episodes; distributing 55 episodes of Peep nationwide to public television stations and increasing their distribution of the show; reaching Spanish-speaking audiences with both the Peep programs in Spanish on V-me and educator resources in Spanish online; developing PeepÆs social media presence; and continuing to enhance the educational value of Peep as a tool for teaching preschool educators.   Through these efforts, we have had impact in the following areas:  We successfully broadened PeepÆs curriculum with the addition of "Anywhere Math." Building on the lessons learned from the formative evaluation of two math stories we produced in the previous season, we produced six new math stories, which our advisors assessed. Their assessment was documented by Goodman Research Group, Inc. Our advisors believed that the new Peep math stories fit well with the existing style and appeal of Peep programs, and that they conveyed the math concepts clearly and accurately.

Since itÆs launch on the Peep Web site, these Spanish resources have received twice the number of page visits as the English resources.  We enhanced PeepÆs educational value for preschool educators and the children they serve by expanding the Peep ExplorerÆs Guide from three units to six. This enabled us to provide preschool educators with significantly more opportunities and ways to engage children in science investigations. Working closely with Content Director Karen Worth and Cindy Hoisington of EDC, the three additional units we researched and developed were: Explore Colors, Explore Sounds, and Explore Ramps. We selected these content areas because they complemented the other three units in the Guide, were appropriate for a preschool science curriculum, and there w...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
