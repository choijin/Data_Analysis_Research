<AbstractNarration>In this project, a large team of investigators will resolve evolutionary relationships within the bivalves (clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, etc.). Bivalves are a diverse and familiar group of mollusks with an old and well-preserved fossil record. Bivalves have important ecological roles in marine and freshwater ecosystems, and economic roles including fisheries, the ornament industry, and health sciences. Bivalves are the second largest class of living mollusks, which in turn constitute the second largest animal phylum and the largest in the marine realm. The evolutionary history and relationships of bivalves will be investigated through a fresh look at bivalve anatomy in combination with study of selected DNA markers for the same species investigated morphologically. This international team of investigators will assemble morphological and molecular phylogenetic data at levels of detail never before attempted. Outreach activities will engage various audiences in the project's results and in evolutionary science as a whole. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project presents an excellent opportunity for outreach to communicate the concepts of evolution, and this team of researchers is well-placed to accomplish this. Museum exhibits and instructional materials using bivalves will be developed for K-12 teachers and their students, post-secondary teachers and their students, and the general public, in the form of a traveling exhibit ("Evolution on the Half-Shell") and associated teaching materials. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Clams, mussels, and oysters have important ecological roles in today&rsquo;s marine and freshwater ecosystems, and economic roles including fisheries, the ornament industry, and health sciences. As high-throughput filter feeders, they play a crucial role in water filtering, water quality maintenance, and nutrient exchange in all marine and freshwater ecosystems. In the marine environment, they are especially important in near-coast shallow water environments, such as the Chesapeake Bay. &nbsp;Bivalves are extremely species rich -- representing the second largest class of living mollusks (which also includes land snails, squids, the extinct ammonites, and many others). This project brought together a diverse team of investigators (with participating research institutions from eight States of the Union, DC, plus international collaborators on five continents). The research team generated a large amount of new data and assembled a wide range of newly acquired morphological and molecular data sets, traced the evolutionary relationships within the bivalves, and successfully inferred the branching pattern of the "Bivalve Tree of Life." The evolutionary history and relationships of bivalves have been investigated through a fresh look at bivalve anatomy in combination with study of selected DNA markers for the same species investigated morphologically. &nbsp;Results included a new classification system for all living Bivalvia, consisting of six major lineages (Protobranchia, Pteriomorphia, Palaeoheterodonta, Archiheterodonta, Anomalodesmata, and Imparidentia), with representatives of all living bivalve families included in the latest phase of the study. Many novel morphological characters were discovered and explored, ranging from features of gills and stomachs (which also helps us discover their dietary requirements and consequently their impact on ecosystem services) to the ultrastructure of sperm (which will support research into modes of reproduction and environmental resilience of bivalves), and the crystalline microstructure of the shell (which delivers, among others, data to analyze the fossil record with greater accuracy).
