<AbstractNarration>This four-year Phase II scholarship and stipend project is building on a previous four-year Phase I project.  Ten two-year $20,000 scholarships are being awarded to undergraduates majoring in mathematics or one of the sciences entering a single subject credential teacher preparation program, and twenty $10,000 one-year stipends to post-baccalaureate STEM professionals undertaking teacher certification studies.  An emphasis is being placed on the recruitment of students interested in teaching one of the physical sciences.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monitoring and evaluation of the Phase I outcomes is being expanded and extended.   Longitudinal data will be collected for a minimum of the initial five years of the Noyce scholar's teaching career.  The overall goals of the evaluation are to track, describe and assess the progress of the scholars and success as they fulfill their teaching service obligations, analyze the effectiveness of the Noyce program, and support data-driven decisions to strengthen the program and its outcomes over time.</AbstractNarration>
