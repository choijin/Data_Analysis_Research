<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to design daily electricity markets for efficiency, incentive compatibility, robustness, and smart grid considerations.  The approach is to first establish economic foundations of electricity auctions through effective use of the extended optimality conditions for mixed-integer problems and the introduction of the novel ?local incentive compatibility? concept.  The theory will be substantiated on a few promising auction models for equilibrium, incentive compatibility, efficiency, revenue balance, and practicality in implementation.  The results will then be extended to stochastic formulations to accommodate intermittent and uncertain renewable generation, and to make effective use of smart metering infrastructure for market-based demand response through innovative integration of stochastic programming, Lagrangian relaxation, and stochastic dynamic programming.  &lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merits include a new perspective to look at electricity markets; substantiate the results on promising models based on a synergistic integration of latest results from mathematics, economics, and our insights on markets; and the novel approach to formulate and solve stochastic auction problems.  The proposed research shall have the broader impacts of enabling the research, development, and policy-making communities to assess the merits of key auction mechanisms to realize green and robust electricity markets.  It will also contribute to auction theory and practice of other fields with similar characteristics, e.g., natural gas and supply chain.  Finally, the research will educate graduate/undergraduate students and professionals through research, courses, seminars, online materials, CD/DVD offerings, and UConn?s da Vinci program for high school teachers and counselors.  The participations of under-represented groups will be actively sought.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The increasing ecological burden of our lifestyle is threatening the integrity of the entire biomes, and our global environmental footprint exceeds the worldÆs regeneration capacity by about 30%.  To reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and alleviate greenhouse gas emissions, the use of renewable energy such as wind and solar has attracted worldwide attention.  However, the intermittent nature of wind and solar brings major challenges in meeting system demand, e.g., the calling for an emergency electric curtailment plan by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas in February 2008 caused by a sudden drop of wind.  To ensure grid-wide reliability, substantial reserves from conventional generation are usually required.  Such large reserves, however, are the dark secret behind intermittent renewables as they induce significant costs.  The issues would become much more severe as the level of renewable penetration increases.  The goals of this project are therefore (1) exploring novel formulations for robust grid integration of intermittent renewables; (2) developing a new generation of approaches for complicated mixed-integer optimization problems; and (3) investigating electricity market design issues, including Extended Locational Marginal Pricing (ELMP) and ramp requirement design.     With respect to problem formulation (1), our approach is to make effective use of Markovian properties of intermittent renewables to alleviate the complexity of stochastic programming approaches using representative scenarios while overcoming the conservativeness of robust optimization approaches involving complicated mini-max problems.  When transmission capacity constraints are considered, our hybrid Markovian-interval formulation represents a balance between optimality and complexity, and opens a new and effective way to address complicated stochastic problems.   As for the solution methodology (2), Lagrangian relaxation has been a fundamental decomposition and coordination approach to solve large-scale integer or mixed-integer optimization problems with much reduced complexity and near-optimal performance.  However, traditional Lagrangian relaxation suffers from several major difficulties.  Our new Surrogate Lagrangian Relaxation method overcomes all these difficulties, and opens up many new directions for solving this important but difficult class of optimization problems for which tight formulations and facet-defining cuts may not be obtainable.  In addition, the method has been synergistically integrated with branch-and-cut to explore both separability and linearity of a problem at the same time.  Preliminary results on this integration are very exciting, especially in view of the invariance of subproblem convex hulls.  As for electricity market design (3), the "Subgradient Simplex Cutting Plane Method" developed in the project is effective for "Extended Locational Marginal Pricing" (ELMP) where multiplier optimality is essential.  Our work on "Approximate Extended Locational Marginal Pricing" (aELMP) then derived guidelines for the allocation of commitment costs of fast-start units for practical implementation by Independent System Operators (ISOs).  The guidelines are consistent with an ISOÆs allocation design, and provide a theoretical justification for its practice.  Furthermore, our study on ramp requirement design identified a subtle issue in the design, and the revised design guaranteed reliable and efficient integration of intermittent renewables based on deterministic unit commitment and economic dispatch, a perspective different from stochastic unit commitment and economic dispatch.
