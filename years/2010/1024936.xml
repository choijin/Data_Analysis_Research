<AbstractNarration>Quantum Monte Carlo is among the most precise simulation techniques to study realistic materials in physics and chemistry and provides a significant gain in precision compared with traditional density functional theory. One significant limitation of today?s QMC methods is the high computational demand. Since a substantial part of the QMC computation is spent in on forming and evaluating Slater determinants, the team plans to develop different localization transformations in order to obtain sparse determinants. The sparsity can be exploited in multilevel preconditioners, incomplete decomposition preconditioners, and iterative solvers to reach linear scaling with system size. The newly developed QMC methods will enable the team to obtain accurate equations of state, phase transitions, and elasticity of solid materials that are of high interest in geophysics. The spin state of iron in solid solutions magnesiowustite, perovskite and post-perovskite (Mg,Fe)SiO3 as well as the properties of water-carbon dioxide mixtures will be determined using QMC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our understanding of the interior of the Earth comes from seismic observations and from the characterization of geological materials at high pressure. This characterization is not only obtained with high-pressure laboratory experiments but also with computer simulations because the properties of materials depend on the interactions between the atoms and those can be determined with computer simulations from the fundamental laws of physics. This project focuses on making those simulation methods much more accurate by developing new mathematical techniques to improve the quantum Monte Carlo method. These newly developed methods will enable the team to characterize different metal oxides, silicates, and mixtures of fluid water and carbon dioxide at high pressure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this collaborative project was to develop novel algorithms to calculate the electronic properties of materials under extreme conditions, in particular, to determine the pressure versus density of materials commonly found in the earthÆs interior.  This project  used  "quantum Monte Carlo" methods to determine the energy of various materials; these methods have been shown to give the highest accuracy for systems involving many electrons. Ceperley, the investigator at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, focused on the following aspects of this project:     developing much more efficient algorithms for determining forces. Forces are important since they can be used to determine the crystal structure of materials that may not be accessible in the laboratory.  The new methods have been implemented and tested in the software we have developed. using the newly determined  algorithm for forces, the team benchmarked density functionals that can be used to compute dynamical properties.  We found that functionals incorporating van der Waals interactions were much better at computing total energies  and forces but the pressures coming from the local density functional were more accurate. developing a community quantum Monte Carlo code that incorporates these algorithms.  The developed QMCPACK code is used by scientists from around the world, in particular, by scientists, including those in this collaboration, doing calculations of the properties of solids at high pressures. optimizing this code for high performance computing .  The code is optimized to run on the worldÆs most powerful computers such as Blue Waters (U of Illinois, NSF), Mira (Argonne, DOE) and Titan (OakRidge, DOE).  educating young scientists in the use of these methods at 2 schools:   The 2012 Summer School on Computational Materials Science: "Quantum Monte Carlo: Theory and Fundamentals" held July 23-27, 2012 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  The lecture slides are freely available on the schoolÆs website.  The videos are available on YouTube (http://tinyurl.com/ltn7qmo).  Another QMC training was held at Argonne National Laboratory during July 2014. The material developed is available at: (http://events.alcf.anl.gov/qmc-2014) and the videos are available at:                          (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdca2X8NEbjX_oYv60vS4gA)          Last Modified: 12/19/2014       Submitted by: David M Ceperley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
