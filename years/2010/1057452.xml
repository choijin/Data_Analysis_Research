<AbstractNarration>The quarter million specimens in the Oregon State University Ichthyology Collection (OSUIC) have supported research on fish biodiversity and conservation since 1935.  Recently a lack of expansion space, an outdated card-based cataloging system and insufficient finances have stymied the OSUIC's growth and prevented researchers around the globe from accessing the collection's holdings easily. This project will solve these problems by 1) installing mobile compact shelving that will increase shelf space by 43% and 2) creating an online, remotely accessible collection database. These critical upgrades will allow the OSUIC to archive new specimens and ensure that it continues to serve as a center for research on fishes from the Pacific Northwest and beyond for decades to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to upgrading the collection's infrastructure, this project will engage precollege students with some of the most spectacular OSUIC specimens in hands-on Discovery Units, provide training and financial support to undergraduate and graduate students, and develop a new online Systematics of Fishes course. In that course, photographs of specimens of more than 400 species will generate a virtual teaching collection, thereby replicating the laboratory-intensive experience of the current on-campus offering. By its conclusion, the project will offer students, scientists and the public vastly improved online access to information in a biodiversity library that has until now been accessible only to scholars behind closed doors.</AbstractNarration>

Despite continued scientific use, the OSICÆs physical facilities declined in the late 20th century due to a lack of space for growth and insufficient funding.  Simultaneously, a lack of computerization discouraged researchers elsewhere from accessing its specimens.  To restore the scientific and educational value of the OSIC, we upgraded it physically by installing mobile compact shelving in a renovated collection facility, thereby increasing available shelf space substantially. We also upgraded it digitally by modernizing the collectionÆs catalog of specimens and making the holdings searchable online. Through the completion of this project, one of the most important libraries of ichthyological diversity on the west coast of the US is again stable, safe, properly curated, and accessible to the world's community of scientists.   Both of the project's major goals have been accomplished.  In the initial phase (2010-2011), the collection was brought into compliance with modern fire and earthquake safety regulations in a newly renovated facility including 2 hour firewalls, sprinkler upgrades, a dedicated HVAC system, explosionproof circuitry and other enhancements.  Specimens are now housed in proper vessels, including 70 archival-quality steel tanks that contain the largest specimens. A compact mobile shelving increases shelf space by nearly 40% and provides for at least 2 decades of growth capacity.  After moving into the new facility in the summer of 2011, work focused on digitizing the collection's historical database, which in 2010 existed in a combination of an Excel file, several leather-bound ledgers, and nearly 20,000 hand-written index cards.
