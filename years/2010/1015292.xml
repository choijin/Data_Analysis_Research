<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Why do deer have such imposing antlers?  The answer: sexual selection, which describes a process by which individuals are selected for their ability to secure mating opportunities.  Those unable to do so fail to pass their genes on to the next generation. Males of many species compete for access to potential mating partners. Male deer use their antlers to engage in combat with one another to get the best mates.  For a long time, this is where biologists thought that sexual selection ended.  We know now about post-copulatory sexual selection; sexual selection that takes place after the mating act has ended.  I study one process in particular: sperm competition.  Just as male deer fight one another for access to females, the individual sperm of different males will compete to fertilize a femaleÆs eggs.    Sperm competition can have huge evolutionary implications because those males with genes that allow them to survive and reproduce will be the ones to pass on their genes.  A male with competitive sperm fertilizes more eggs than his rivals.  Males of many species can adjust the competitiveness of their sperm according to the likelihood that they will actually face sperm competition.  This likelihood is known as sperm competition risk. Theory predicts that males should increase their ejaculate investment as sperm competition risk increases.    How do males assess sperm competition risk?  In many species, males have the opportunity to directly and physically interact with one another.  However, a number of species are solitary and rarely come into direct physical contact with rivals.  Social cues may be a way to assess risk.  More specifically, males may use visual, chemical, or acoustic cues to determine how many potential rivals exist.  This is what I chose to study for my EAPSI project. To carry out this study, I worked with Prof. Leigh W. Simmons, one of the world's leading experts on sperm competition, at the University of Western Australia in Perth, Australia.   We used Pacific field crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to test the effects of social cues on sperm competition.  Prior work found that these crickets are sensitive to changes in their acoustic environment; crickets reared in noisy environments are different from those reared in silent environments in many ways.  Given that these crickets are sensitive to acoustic cues, they posed a perfect opportunity to test the role of such cues in assessing sperm competition risk.  Males living in noisy environments should perceive high levels of risk &ndash; someone has to be making all that noise, and males are the only sex that calls.  Males living in silent environments should perceive little to no risk &ndash; if nobody is singing, then nobody is around.  Thus, males in noisy environments should invest more in their ejaculates than males living in silent environments. Importantly, Prof. Simmons and his laboratory had already worked out the major components of sperm competition in this species. Recall that males may increase sperm competitiveness in many different ways.  This can make studies on sperm competition quite difficult.  However, Prof. Simmons and his colleagues found that one characteristic in particular mattered for these crickets: sperm viability, the proportion of live sperm contained within an ejaculate.   To test this, we reared male crickets individually in one of two acoustic treatments: a noisy environment or a silent environment.  We let the males live in these environments for at least two weeks before testing them for sperm viability.  This involved staining a maleÆs ejaculate with two different fluorescent dyes: one to stain the live sperm, and another to stain the dead sperm.  When the stains are applied, live sperm show up under a fluorescent microscope as bright green sperm cells, while dead sperm are a bright red-orange.   As a æbonusÆ, we were able to use these crickets in a related project measuring the expression of chemical compounds on the cut...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
