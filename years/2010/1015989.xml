<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. François Richard and an international team of colleagues will conduct one field season of archaeological survey in the province of Siin (Senegal) between January and March 2011. The project is a collaborative effort combining U.S. and Senegalese archaeologists to examine the centuries immediately preceding and following the advent of Atlantic contacts in Senegal in 1444. The Atlantic era is one of the most intensely researched stretches of human history and a defining moment in Africa's past, yet it is also a relatively poorly understood period. The 'transitional period' (A.D. 1300-1700) connecting Iron Age societies to the early centuries of global encounters is particularly obscure in West Africa. This is in part because our knowledge of the period rests on a small corpus of testimonies left by European navigators, which offer a limited purview of African societies at the time of contact and say little about them before that. Archaeology can redress these difficulties, by offering empirical glimpses of the African past before the advent of documented history and generating independent evidence to complement historical records during the Atlantic era. When confronted with other sources, archaeological datasets can point to gaps or inconsistencies in our historical understanding, and craft a richer portrayal of African experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Siin provides a compelling point of entry into questions of historical transitions in Senegambia, the area of Africa with the longest record of contacts with Europe. Between 1300-1700, the region witnessed momentous events, involving massive population migrations, the development of a centralized kingdom, and the incorporation of the region into global circuits of exchange. Despite its small size, the Siin polity was deeply implicated in the historical processes that fashioned the Senegambian past, and its turbulent history is poised to cast critical light on the political, economic, and cultural transformations that accompanied African communities' transitions into the Atlantic era. This history has left significant material traces in the form of ancient villages and other vestiges of past social life, which are readily amenable to archaeological analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigation of Atlantic transitions in Siin requires the collection of archaeological information at the regional scale. To do so, the research team will conduct a systematic pedestrian survey in three study areas selected for their association with the high points of Siin's history. The survey will examine 8% of the ground surface in these three regions in search for remains of past activities, with a special focus on settlements datable to the transitional period. This research will identify residential sites and document their artifact inventories. The project's goals are to get a better understanding of 1) settlement systems and their variability over time, and 2) the composition of artifact assemblages and the cultural practices of which they are the remnants. Combining these two elements, and with the assistance of specialized compositional analysis on ceramics collected during the survey, the research will help to reconstruct political, economic, and social organization in the region, and chart their transformations over time. Lastly, the survey will also be used to locate two well-preserved sites for future excavation with the purpose of shedding light on the dynamics of village life during the transitional period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute important information at both conceptual and substantive levels. Substantively, it will produce alternative perspectives on the long-term history of Siin and Senegambia. Conceptually, it will generate new models about the impact of global historical forces on African societies, and thus will contribute to important debates in contemporary archaeology about the nature and dynamics of 'colonial encounters.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regard to broader impacts, the study will foster new understanding about an obscure yet foundational period of African history, which has never been the object of systematic investigations in Senegal. This, in turn, will provide the basis for revisions in historical portrayals of Senegal and Atlantic Africa, and key contributions to scholarly research on indigenous people's long-term engagement with European colonialism. The project will also be a forum for cross-cultural collaboration and learning between Senegalese and American students and professionals, and consultation with the rural communities of Siin about their past.</AbstractNarration>
