<AbstractNarration>This project provides approximately 14 scholarships each year during the 4.5-year grant period to academically talented, low-income Biology/Biotechnology undergraduate and graduate students at William Paterson University.  The project goals include increasing the number of Biology/Biotechnology majors entering research and education careers; increasing the retention and graduation rates of all Biology/Biotechnology students; increasing the number of minority students in the Biology/Biotechnology Graduate programs by 25%; and increasing the number of Biology/Biotechnology Masters degree recipients.  The project supports tutoring, mentoring, faculty-guided research experiences, career guidance and internships for the scholarship recipients.  The project addresses regional and national needs, and enhances the Biology/Biotechnology programs at the University by providing opportunities for graduate education for traditionally underrepresented groups.  The project results are being disseminated in various ways such as project reports and University publications and press releases to regional media outlets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ William Paterson University of New Jersey received an NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) grant titled Increasing Undergraduate and Graduate Student Success in Biology and Biotechnology (ISSBB2).  The award was funded in January 2011 and lasted through May 2015.  It was a $592,095 grant to provide scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students and focused on increasing retention and graduation rates of students majoring in biology and biotechnology. The scholarships supplement recipientsÆ financial aid package and reduce financial debt by awards of up to $9,000/ year.  59 students (52 undergraduates and 7 graduate students) received scholarships.     Of the 52 undergraduates, 11 are still in school and on schedule to graduate.  One student transferred out of the university and only one other student left.  Of the undergraduates who entered WPUNJ as freshmen, 75% were able to graduate in 4 years. The retention rate (96%) of the undergraduates also looks very high. The average GPA of the graduating scholars was 3.54.     The 4 year graduation rate for Biology majors at WPUNJ is 24%.  It is clear that something needs to be done to improve this. By any measure, the ISSBB grant has been an excellent tool for retention and graduation of the scholars.   As discussed above, a high number of those scholars who came to WPUNJ as first year full-time (FY/FT) students were able to graduate in 4 years. Obviously there is something these students are getting which is affecting retention and speeding up graduation.  In addition to the scholarships, ISSBB scholars were closely monitored and actively advised.   Their mentor strongly encouraged attendance at meetings of the Garden State &ndash; Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (GS-LSAMP).  They also attended ISSBB meetings, dinners, and Career Days.  They are given the opportunity for research and internships, are strongly encouraged to attend tutoring, and have their own peer tutor.  They therefore are a tight group with an identity within the program. Even if they dropped out of the program, if they remained in the major they retained the same mentor/advisor and were monitored academically.  The active advisement/cohort building of this group seemed to increase overall retention and graduation rates.  One goal of WPUNJÆs S-STEM grant application was to reduce the "success gap" of minority students with respect to retention and graduation rates by 25% from the baseline data. With a Hispanic population of 26.4%, William Paterson University is a Hispanic serving institution. WPU has been successful in attracting under-represented minority students to its Biology/Biotechnology programs, with around 41% of the majors in this category at the grantÆs beginning in 2011. The most recent numbers show the departmental under-represented minority student population is around 45%. The racial profile of the ISSBB scholars reflects this.  However, the problem has always been not only the recruitment of minority students, but their retention and graduation.  Although 35-45% of the Biology undergraduates have been minority students over the past 10 years, only 18-30% of the graduates were. However, 39% of the students who have graduated from the ISSBB program are from underrepresented minorities, consistent with their percentage in the program.   It is hard to draw any conclusions on the effect the grant might have had on the overall population of Biology majors.  It has been discussed that the combination of mentoring and cohort building which have been so successful for the ISSBB Scholars could be extended to the department majors as a whole.     Another of the goals of the program was to expand the numbers of Biology majors going into STEM careers.   Not only have we awarded ISSBB scholarships to students who are going into these careers, we have also emphasized these careers to all majors at our monthly meetings of the GS-LSAMP program and at ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
