<AbstractNarration>The research team, in this collaborative proposal, aims to compare speleothem records, instrumental observations of the last ~100 years, and climate models to study Caribbean climate spanning the last millennium.  The research team will address two foundational questions with their project, as follows: (1) What do the high-resolution Caribbean speleothem delta oxygen-18 isotope records, together with Cariaco Basin sediments, indicate about the low-frequency, Caribbean-wide hydroclimate variations during the Late Holocene? and (2) What can be learned about the large scale Atlantic-Pacific climate interactions during the late Holocene by comparing the detailed regional Caribbean hydroclimate history with other proxy records outside the region?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, most notable at the University of Puerto Rico.  The research results on tropical hydrology could have widespread utility in the study of climate and water resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A significant portion of the worldÆs population, including parts of the United States and its territories, is directly dependent upon local precipitation as their only source of fresh water.  By "directly dependent" we mean the catching of rainfall on a house by house basis and stored for later use, as opposed to groundwater or surface reservoirs whose water is then transferred/transported to another location for use.  Computer models of future climate change suggest some areas will experience an increase in precipitation while some areas will become substantially drier.   One region that directly dependent upon local precipitation and is predicted to become drier over this century is the circum-Caribbean.  Unfortunately, the forcing mechanisms that drive precipitation variability for this region are complicated and not well-understood.  The purpose of this project was to reconstruct precipitation changes across the Caribbean over the last 1000 years to better understand preanthropogenic-influenced rates and ranges of precipitation variability, and to attempt to separate the forcing mechanisms from the low- and high-latitude Atlantic and Pacific that drive this variability.  We collected cave deposits (speleothems) from across the Caribbean &ndash; the growth rate and chemistry of the speleothems is a function of precipitation.  We also analyzed marine sediments from the southern Caribbean for elements that are only brought into the ocean by rivers &ndash; another proxy for precipitation.  Both the speleothem and the sediment records act as a natural history book and allow us to examine precipitation variability through the geologic past.  There have been several significant findings to date:  1)  We have established a link between large-scale volcanic eruption clusters and multidecadal intervals of drought in Mesoamerica.  This link is important for several reasons.  It shows that volcanic aerosols can potentially impact climate for a much longer period of time than currently thought.  Second, one possible geoengineering approach to mitigating current global warming patterns is to release sulfate aerosols into the upper atmosphere.  Conclusions from our project suggest aerosol release will cause substantial drought in the eastern Caribbean.  2)  Further back in time, precipitation variability in the northwestern Caribbean has been linked to societal changes in the earliest human settlers of Puerto Rico, strengthening the connection between climate change and societal change.  3)  Precipitation variability in the southern Caribbean has typically been thought to be driven by variations in the annual position of the meteorological equator &ndash; the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and its associated rainfall.  Our data suggest that precipitation changes in this region are likely also influenced by variations in the intensity of the Hadley Cell (the large atmospheric circulation cell in the tropics) or variations in the strength of the South American monsoon.  This project was a collaborative effort amongst researchers at the University of Puerto Rico, Columbia UniversityÆs Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and Stony Brook University.   In addition the large societal implications of our research, Stony BrookÆs portion of the project helped to support a female graduate student.
