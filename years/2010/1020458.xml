<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit:  &lt;br/&gt;Methane is an important fuel and a major greenhouse gas linked to global warming.  The current biological production of methane in nature is solely due to the methanogens a diverse group of strictly anaerobic microorganisms belonging to the newly recognized domain of life, the archaea.  By generating methane in a process known as methanogenesis, these organisms facilitate the anaerobic degradation of complex polymers such as cellulose and starch that are produced by plants and, in so doing, play a central role in the global carbon cycle.  Further, one of the modes of methanogenesis in which carbon dioxide and hydrogen are converted to methane and water is considered one of the most ancient forms of respiration on Earth.  Although much has been learned about the biochemical pathways of methane formation, little is known as to how the process is regulated in response to change in environmental conditions. Importantly, it is not known how methanogens cope with sporadic exposure to oxygen, a common occurrence in their natural habitats.  It is possible that, under moderate oxygen contamination, the organisms modify their cellular machinery so that methanogenesis is sustained--an important capability since methane formation represents their only source of energy.  Preliminary studies indicate that modification of key enzymes by thioredoxin (Trx) plays a role in this control strategy.  Trx is a ubiquitous regulatory protein that acts in partnership with an enzyme, Trx reductase, in the fine control of metabolism.  However, this system remains unexplored in the methanogens, despite the fact that every member of this group carries genes with the potential for encoding these proteins.  In this project we will test the concept that Trx/Trx reductase-based control is a determinant for the biological production of methane.  We will utilize two methanogenic archaea as models: (i) Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, a deeply rooted autotroph that inhabits deep-sea hydrothermal vents and produces methane exclusively from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and (ii) Methanosarcina mazei, a late-evolving freshwater methanogen with more diverse methanogenic capability.  The latter organism will be investigated in collaboration with the University of Kiel (Germany).  The objectives of the study are: (i) To characterize the putative Trxs and Trx reductases of M. jannaschii and M. mazei using proteins over-produced in a methanogen host, thereby providing in vivo relevance to the investigation; (ii) To identify the enzymes and other proteins that Trx modifies in these organisms; and (iii) To determine the effect of Trx-based modification on the activity of select methanogenic enzymes.  The work will provide an entrée to broader contemporary questions relating to the control of methanogenesis in natural habitats and to how redox-based control systems of bacteria, animals and plants evolved from those originating in the archaea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;This research will elucidate how methane-producing microorganisms cope with the challenging effects of exposure to oxygen in their habitats.  Consequently, it will have broad societal and scientific implications relating to energy production, recycling of carbon in the biosphere and global warming.  Greater insight into the regulation of methane formation raises the possibility of controlling its production in a useful manner?e.g., in bioreactors and sewage digesters. The project will integrate research and education through the training of two graduate students, four undergraduates, and a high school student.  Undergraduate students and high school teachers from a current NSF-REU program directed by the PI ("Microbiology in the Post-Genome Era") will have an opportunity to participate in this research.  Every effort will be made to recruit from underrepresented minority groups at all levels.  The collaborative training will broaden the research experience of graduate students in the participating laboratories at Virginia Tech, University of Kiel and University of California-Berkeley.  Its scientific and societal relevance coupled with the participation of a diverse group of investigators at different career stages will enrich the project as well as the research experience of all participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BACKGROUND:     The investigation was focused on one of the mechanisms that methanogens use to deal with exposure to oxygen and change in the availability of energy nutrients.     Methanogens are oxygen-sensitive (strictly anaerobic) microorganisms belonging to the domain of life called archaea; other domains are bacteria and eukaryotes. Plants and animals, including humans, are eukaryotes.  Methanogens produce methane, a valuable fuel (principal component of natural gas) and as well as a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. The process of methane production by methanogens is called methanogenesis.      Methanogens are ancient inhabitants of the Earth developing approximately 3.5 billion years ago, about 1 billion years before oxygen appeared in the atmosphere.  Consequently, they harbor clues to the early steps of the development of life on Earth.     TodayÆs methanogens live in a variety of anaerobic niches such as deep-sea volcanoes (hydrothermal vents), freshwater and marine sediments, cowsÆ foregut (rumen), human and animal large intestines, and rice paddy fields.  In hydrothermal vents methanogens use hydrogen from volcanic water as an energy source and produce biomass that serves as a food source for other organisms.  This action mimics photosynthesis by plants that generates food for others using sunlight.  In the sediments, such as those found at the bottom of a lake, methanogens are key members of microbial teams that degrade accumulated biomass and release the carbon present therein into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide for use by plants for photosynthesis.  A similar process is utilized in the anaerobic treatment of municipal and industrial wastes that removes harmful materials and generates methane as a by-product.  This process could also be used for the commercial production of natural gas from agricultural wastes and renewable resources such as plant materials in an environmentally friendly manner.  A good part of the methane in natural gas resulted from the action of methanogens hundreds of million years ago. Methane released from mines and natural production sites and by ruminants also contributes to climate change.     THE PROJECT:  Methanogens are occasionally exposed to oxygen in their natural habitats; some recover from such incidents.  For many anaerobic environments occasional to frequent limitation of hydrogen availability is a common feature and this poses a serious problem for methanogens that use hydrogen as an energy source.  Oxygen exposure and hydrogen limitation impose similar challenges to methanogens, since both oxidize and consequently deactivate (temporarily inactivate) many enzymes and other cellular proteins.  Our project focused on elucidating a mechanism that enables methanogens to reactivate deactivated proteins when conditions conducive for growth are restored&mdash;for example, anaerobic conditions or adequate hydrogen supply.     OUTCOMES:  The study shows that methanogens use a thioredoxin-based system for the reactivation of oxidized proteins similar to the one that enables plants to turn on photosynthesis in response to light.  Thioredoxin is a small protein with two specific cysteines (amino acids) that are the key to its activity.  Ancient methanogens, that live in hydrothermal vents with an environment resembling that on the early Earth, primarily use hydrogen as an energy source. These organisms possess simple thioredoxin systems composed of three proteins.  The more complex recent arrivals, that utilize a variety of compounds for energy production and live in numerous niches of nature, have more complicated thioredoxin systems composed of up to 11 proteins. Methanogens are key players in the microbial degradation of feed in the rumen that provides nutrition for ruminants such as cows and sheep. A similar process occurring in the large intestine of humans may contribute to type 2 diabetes and obesity when operating in an uncontrolled fashion.  In both cas...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
