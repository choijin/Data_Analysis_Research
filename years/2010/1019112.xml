<AbstractNarration>Grammatical convergence, the achievement of structural similarity among languages, is widely considered to be an inevitable consequence of bilingualism, and code-switching, the alternation of different languages in a single speech event, has been assumed to be a key mechanism in such convergence. This study investigates the role of code-switching in promoting grammatical convergence in the long-standing New Mexican bilingual community, where there is regular code-switching between Spanish and English. This research targets patterns of first person singular subject (yo 'I') expression, and tests the hypothesis of grammatical convergence via code-switching through comparing the structure of variable first singular subject expression in (1) monolingual varieties of Spanish and English, (2) bilinguals of varying levels of bilingualism, and (3) the presence versus the absence of code-switching. Given observed effects of monolingual and bilingual structural priming, or repetition of the same grammatical form, this research is expected to demonstrate that cross-linguistic priming plays a role in ostensible convergence by modestly increasing the rate of a parallel structure in the presence of code-switching without involving change in language-particular grammatical patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research advances the understanding of the language varieties spoken by bilinguals. In recording the speech of New Mexican bilinguals, it will contribute to the documentation of the oldest surviving Spanish dialect on the continent. The materials that arise from this research can be incorporated into the development of pedagogical resources for heritage language teaching at various levels throughout the United States. Finally, while labels such as "Spanglish" may imply that switching between languages involves haphazard language mixing and leads to grammatical deterioration, by showing the systematic structure of bilingual discourse, this research promotes greater public awareness of the realities of US Spanish and helps to counter the stigmatization of bilingual language varieties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Does bilingualsÆ switching between two languages inherently promote grammatical convergence, resulting in one language becoming grammatically more similar to the other? This project has advanced the study of bilingualism through community-based data collection and analysis of linguistic variation in both of the languages in contact. The Community  Spanish and English have co-existed as the main competing languages for over 150 years in the northern part of the southwestern state of New Mexico (Bills &amp; Vigil 2008). Speakers of New Mexican Spanish and English thus provide a precious window into bilingualism, allowing for a compelling evaluation of long-term grammatical convergence.  Project participants are all at least third-generation Nuevomexicanos æNew MexicansÆ. The 23 women and 17 men, born between 1923 and 1989, were selected to cover a range of demographic backgrounds (mineworkers, ranchers, schoolteachers and others), allowing extra-linguistic constraints on linguistic variation to be assessed. All meet the criterion of regular use of both languages. The NMSEB Corpus  The New Mexico Spanish-English Bilingual (NMSEB) corpus records bilingual speech through the community-based method of sociolinguistic interviews (Labov1984) conducted by in-group members (Poplack 1993). To enable accountable quantitative analysis, the transcription is comprehensive, aligned with the audio recording, and prosodically based, each line of transcript corresponding to an Intonation Unit (Du Bois et al. 1993). Code-switching, the juxtaposition of multi-word sequences of each language, occurs mostly across prosodic units (Fig. 1).   Comprising 31 interviews, for a total of 29 hours of recordings and 340,000 transcribed words, NMSEB is a unique corpus in capturing spontaneous speech in two languages from the same speakers, not only single-word insertations but alternations between multi-word sequences. The NMSEB corpus has fostered wide-ranging research, including publication of a special issue of the International Journal of Bilngualism (August 2015).    Evaluating convergence: comparisons of linguistic variation patterns  Subject pronoun expression (yo 'I', ella 'she') has been considered a paradigmatic case for grammatical convergence in US Spanish. Here we evaluated the wide-spread hypothesis of 'grammatical convergence via code-switching' by comparing constraints on the variation, or the statstical effects of linguistic contextual factors favoring or disfavoring subject pronoun expression. Constraints are compared across each of the languages in contact (Fig. 2).  The methodological premise for evaluating grammatical convergence is that:  Intra-linguistic variation serves to gauge inter-linguistic grammatical (dis)similarity  To evaluate convergence, parallel constraints due to cross-linguistic tendencies, such as accessibility effects on subject pronoun expression, are distinguished from language-specific constraints, such as an initial-position prosodic restriction on unexpressed subjects in English. At this locus of structural dissimilarity, New Mexican Spanish aligns with monolingual Spanish and not with English, ruling out grammatical convergence. Code-switching: Does it involve convergence?   Does code-switching result in Spanish becoming grammatically more like English in New Mexico? The widely-held premise that code-switching inherently promotes grammatical convergence is tested with a novel real-time measure: juxtaposition of multiword sequences of each language, with English in either the same clause or the immediately preceding clause as the Spanish subject (examples (1) and (2), respectively).
