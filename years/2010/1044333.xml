<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary project defines what constitutes global competencies for engineers. It focuses on building knowledge and theory about global competencies in engineering that can be transferrable to other STEM disciplines. This project is constructing foundational knowledge on the complexities and multidimensionality of 'global competency.'  The long-term goal is to develop a shared understanding of what it means to be globally competent in STEM education. A plan is in place to develop a research-supported theoretical framework for defining outcome-based global engineering competencies with the specific goal of understanding stakeholders' perceptions. This research focuses on two specific stakeholder groups: 1) US trained engineers working outside of the US and 2) Employers who hire US trained engineers to work outside of the US. Ultimately, the research is expected to lead to the development of assessment instruments that can monitor both student readiness to be a global citizen and the effectiveness of the training programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the period of the grant, the PIs developed a conceptual framework of global engineer competence to guide development of an assessment instrument. The desired attributes of a globally competent engineer can be conceptualized at three levels: interpersonal/cultural, professional, and technical attributes. Each of these attributes can also be conceptualized as knowledge, skills, and attitudes.  Interpersonal/cultural attributes encompass a broad range of demographic, psychological, and physiological characteristics, traits, skills, qualities, abilities, and attitudes of a person that influence oneÆs level of competency in working with individuals from different cultures. The interpersonal/cultural attribute factor is multifaceted and can be assessed by measuring personality traits and dispositions, such as introversion, extroversion, openness to diversity, conscientiousness, agreeableness, ethnocultural empathy, cultural intelligence, and universal-diverse orientation. Communication style, language skills, and diversity of previous experience (e.g., international travel, parents' nationality, languages spoken at home, contact with culturally different individuals, number of previous residencies, etc.) are also interpersonal/cultural attributes that can be assessed.  The second factor in the framework is professional attributes.

The standards piece highlights various technical standards that a globally competent engineer should be able to apply in an international context.
