<AbstractNarration>Filmmaker's Collaborative, Principal Large-Format LTD, and SK Films, Inc. are requesting funds to produce a large format, 3-D film and multi-component educational materials and activities on the annual migration of monarch butterflies, their life cycle and the web of life at select sites where they land.  Project goals are to  1) raise audience understanding of the nature of scientific investigation and the open-ended nature of the scientific process,  2) enhance and extend citizen science programs to new audiences, and  3) create better awareness of monarch biology, insect ecology and the importance of habitat.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INNOVATION/STRATEGIC  IMPACT:   The film will be simultaneously released in both a 3-D and 2-D 15/70 format.  RMC Research Corp. will conduct evaluation of the project, including a study of the comparable strengths of the 2-D and 3-D versions of the film and to assess the effectiveness of 3-D to enhance the learning experience.  RMC will also conduct a long-term evaluation of the project's citizen science programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLABORATION:   This project promises a highly collaborative model of partnerships between the project team and The Smithsonian, Project Learning Tree, Monarchs in the Classroom, Monarch Watch, 4-H through the University of Kentucky Extension and the University of Florida WINGS programs, The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans (SACNAS), Online NewsHour, and Earth &amp; Sky.  RMC will conduct formative and summative evaluations to assess the success of project materials in communicating science and achieving the project's learning goals.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Flight of the Butterflies project was a successful endeavor, producing a large-format (IMAX) film, associated educational outreach materials and a series of workshops for both formal and informal educators nationwide.  In the nearly three and a half years since its October 2012 premiere, the film has been viewed by more than four million people in 17 countries and has generated $21.5 million in box office revenue.  The film follows the story of Fred and Nora Urquhart and their lifelong search for the overwintering site of monarch butterflies.  Interwoven with their story is the tale of the monarchÆs migration, navigation and life cycle, and the natural and human threats to the monarch.  Audience responses to the film have been positive and enthusiastic.  Viewers questioned in a series of focus groups said it was a "good story well done," describing it as informative and appealing.  A number found it emotionally compelling, one calling it passionate and scientific.  The combination of the UrquhartsÆ personal quest and the science content was deemed very successful.  Viewers enjoyed the weaving together of scientific information and entertainment.   Viewers were impressed by the amount of science in the film.  One area of new learning was citizen science, profiled in the film through efforts of individuals who tag and release monarchs.  Viewers were intrigued with this idea of contributing to significant scientific research.  Many students interviewed said they liked the film much better than they thought they would, and some viewers expressed concern for the future of the monarchs .      The film swept the awards at the annual large-format industry conference in 2013.  The Giant Screen Cinema Association recognized the film for "Best Picture," "Best Picture for Lifelong Learning," "Best Cinematography," "Best Original Score," among others.  It was the first time a film swept the industryÆs awards.  The educational outreach efforts were also very popular.  Educator workshop participants appreciated the opportunities to hear from knowledgeable presenters and to handle live butterflies in all four life-cycle stages, and the variety of take-home materials.  Educators said the workshops increased their content knowledge and provided ideas for engaging both museum visitors and classroom students.  Several participants commented that the workshop had been one of the best they had ever attended.  Close to 1,000 formal and informal educators took part in workshop or associated web seminars.  They represented 39 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and five foreign countries &ndash; Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Turkey and Panama.  The project provided no-cost Traveling Trunks to museums showing the film that also proved popular.  Trunks contained an Educator Guide and CD, a digital microscope and microscope slides, a butterfly farm for raising monarchs, a monarch/viceroy mimicry set, an inflatable monarch life cycle set, a laminated set of 22 flip cards of monarch information, books and a DVD.  Museum educators  indicated that the trunk materials displayed in theater lobbies made visitors more interested in the film and provided opportunities for further discussion.  Educators said that the trunk materials were much more than what is typically provided with films and appreciated materials ready and easy to use.  They suggested that future films should provide similar materials so staff did not need to invest time and resources for a short-lived show.   Project staff developed a set of five seven-foot-tall exhibit banners, dealing with specific monarch-related topics &ndash; A Unique Creature, Life Cycle, Migration, Day In The Life of a Monarch, and Citizen Science.  As with the Traveling Trunks, museums borrowed the banners at no cost for their film runs.  They displayed banners in their museum or theater lobbies, and also used them for local educator workshops.   Mini-grants of $1,500 each were offered to museum educator...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
