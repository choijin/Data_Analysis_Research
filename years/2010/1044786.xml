<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between Evergreen State College and the University of Washington is creating, validating, and disseminating a science process and reasoning skills test (SPARST) to assess students' acquisition of such skills as experimental design, data analysis, graphing, and scientific writing. SPARST is being designed to help biology faculty:  a) gauge the skill level of incoming students, b) revise undergraduate curricula to better address the teaching of skills along with content, c) create a national network for sharing skill-teaching practices and resources, and d) improve the general science literacy of both science majors and non-majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Since there are few tests of this type available within the biological sciences, SPARST will help inform faculty of their effectiveness at helping students develop these skills and will help students become  better prepared to enter graduate school or careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  SPARST is being tested at several institutions and revised iteratively in order to create a valid and reliable test for distribution. The test will be free and available on-line as multiple choice and short-answer questions. It is designed to be graded online; responses to short answer questions will be compiled for ease of grading and faculty will be provided with a validated grading rubric. Faculty who implement SPARST will be provided with a free, descriptive diagnostic of their students' abilities that will indicate how well each student performed on the subset of scaled questions in each science process skill area and how the faculty's class compares to similar biology classes at an anonymous subset of similar institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Undergraduate education in the life sciences tends to focus on discipline-specific content, often at the expense of developing students&rsquo; scientific reasoning abilities and skills. However, many science educators would agree that student acquisition of broad-based science skills is an essential component of any undergraduate science education. A growing body of evidence, from our work and that of others, also indicates that students who either possess science process and reasoning skills, or are taught them in an explicit manner early in undergraduate education, show greater performance in life science courses than students who lack these skills (Dirks and Cunningham). Typically, and with good reason, science process skills are taught through the teaching of content; albeit the focus is usually on teaching the content, not the process. Without direct intent by faculty to teach science process skills, undergraduates science majors may only acquire a subset of the skills they actually need to have comprehensive science literacy. Currently, life science faculty who wish to know if their students are mastering these skills have very few assessment tool options. To address this need we developed the Scientific Process and Reasoning Skills Test (SPARST) to assess students&rsquo; skill acquisition throughout their undergraduate education in the life sciences. SPARST was designed as four different parts to assess students&rsquo; abilities in Data Analysis, Experimental Design, Graphing, and Science Communication. SPARST will help faculty to a) better gauge the skill level of incoming students, b) revise undergraduate curricula to better address the teaching of skills along with content, c) create a national network for sharing skill-teaching practices and resources, and d) improve the general science literacy of both science majors and non-majors.</p> <p>To develop SPARST as a valid and reliable test required us to work closely with a national faculty advisory board, iteratively modify the test based on student feedback, and evaluate how well the test was able to distinguish different students&rsquo; abilities.
