<AbstractNarration>Carnegie Mellon University is adding three new cohorts to its existing Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. Carnegie Mellon has earned an international reputation for its expertise and capability in information assurance research and education. The university's CyLab draws on the largest pool of academic cyber security researchers in the nation and combines top-ranked programs in computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, human-computer interaction, privacy technology and law, and policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFS scholarships are awarded to students in either of two master's degree programs: the MS in Information Security Technology and Management and the MS in Information Security Policy and Management. Carnegie Mellon proposes to add a third master's degree program - the Pittsburgh-Silicon Valley MS in Information Technology and Information Security. The curricula of these programs have been certified pursuant to the Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation Process of the National Security Agency's CNSS 4011 - National Training Standard for Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) Professionals and CNSS 4014 - Information Assurance Training Standard for Information Systems Security Officers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University has been an active and enthusiastic participant in the SFS program since the program's inception. To date, 104 highly qualified students have graduated from the program, have been placed into federal information assurance positions, and make substantial contributions to the efforts of securing the Federal Government's cyberspace.</AbstractNarration>

This report describes the universityÆs dedication to SFS, which includes enhanced recruitment efforts, involvement of faculty and students in research, and exposure of students to a rich variety of federal job opportunities.   Intellectual Merit Under this award, CMU was able to fund 42 full-time equivalent students. CMU students in the SFS program are enrolled in the College of EngineeringÆs Information Networking Institute (INI) or the H. John Heinz III College (HNZ); both top-ranked schools.

Many SFS students elect to take at least one, if not all, of the courses offered in the CyFIR Track.   Broader Impact In order to attract a diverse group of talented U.S. applicants, the INI admissions staff spends significant time traveling to meet with undergraduate students and to build relationships with undergraduate faculty advisors at other universities.   Several efforts have been established in order to attract minorities and women to Carnegie MellonÆs graduate programs. Since 2006, the INI has actively supported the recruitment of women through its sponsorship of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC), the worldÆs largest gathering of women technologists, and by developing a rapport with the leadership of the Executive WomenÆs Forum, an annual conference for leaders in the areas of information security, risk management and privacy. Additionally, the INI plans recruitment visits and information sessions at Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI). These specific events, as well as personalized communication strategies and subsequent word-of-mouth marketing, have led to an increase in applications from minority and female applicants.   Prospective SFS students are acquainted to the program through community-building efforts, such as an open house, which occurs prior to accepting admission, and an SFS welcome dinner at the beginning of the academic year. Throughout the year, SFS students are encouraged to network at social events with one another, as well as with SFS alumni and federal recruiters at campus information sessions.   In recent years, CMU has also furthered its relationship with the National Security Agency (NSA), which benefits the program offerings for our SFS students. The NSAÆs Security Education Academic Liaisons (SEALs) work closely with our faculty and administrators to give advic...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
