<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to integrate readily available simulation tools with a variety of active learning pedagogies to teach engineering concepts.  A unique feature of this project is to use tablet computers to permit students to explain concepts in a qualitative manner in real time, thus allowing rapid formative assessment by content experts.  The project will pilot the innovation in several engineering classes and address issues of scaling the technique to larger class sizes.  Fundamental insights on engineering misconceptions may arise from this project pending successful evaluation of the large number of student artifacts generated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is to allow better use of existing computer-based simulation tools for teaching conceptual content to engineering students.  The teaching methods developed will be piloted in classes with a large number of female students, who are often under-represented in STEM disciplines, as well as summer classes for minority students.  The scalability of the teaching techniques to large classrooms will be investigated to more broadly disseminate the innovations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ TodayÆs educators know that they can help their students learn during class time by actively engaging them with the subject matter. This project coupled two active learning teaching strategies and found strong learning gains in chemical engineering and engineering physics students.  Pen-enabled mobile technology, in this case Tablet PCs, facilitated this coupling.   There are many free computer simulations online that help students grasp abstract and sophisticated STEM concepts that are not easily or directly observable. The simulation is essentially a virtual laboratory where students can use scientific inquiry, change certain variables, and observe the results to discover relationships and principles themselves.  Instructors, however, need to find a balance between providing too much and too little guidance---with too much, inquiry and innovation are stifled, and with too little, students may not arrive at correct understanding.   To guide student exploration of computer simulations, we coupled them with real-time formative assessment and prompt feedback.  During the learning process, the instructor would ask students an open-format question that guided them to investigate certain relationships. These questions focused the studentsÆ attention on important concepts and helped the students realize what they did and didnÆt understand. The student responses were then used by the instructor to reinforce correct understandings and identify and repair any misconceptions before moving on.  In the past, it was difficult to receive and process student responses to real-time formative assessments in an efficient and timely manner.  In this project, we used InkSurvey, a web-based tool developed at Colorado School of Mines and available for free to educators worldwide.  When the instructor posed open-format, concept-based questions, Tablet PC-equipped students used digital ink to graph, draw, write, etc. their responses.  The instructor received these responses instantaneously and used them to inform subsequent instruction.  The real-time formative assessment questions could be seamlessly embedded in instruction since the same mobile device was used for exploration of the simulation and responding to the instructorsÆ questions.   Classes studied in this project included student enrollments exceeding 60 students and diverse student populations, including some courses with a high percentage of under-represented females and also summer pre-college minority students.  In this project, we found stronger learning gains achieved by engineering students when the coupled model was used than when the simulations were used without guiding real-time formative assessment questions and responses.  Although we had anticipated that this pedagogical model may be more effective for students of certain learning styles (e.g., visual learners and/or kinesthetic learners), we discovered that students of all learning styles found their learning enhanced by this coupling.  Furthermore, since student responses can be viewed and projected in anonymous mode, all students are on equal footing regardless of ethnicity, gender, skill level, etc. and otherwise reluctant participants can be more actively engaged in the classroom.   Since the questions posed by the instructor are open-format, rather than multiple choice or short answer, they can probe higher level thinking skills and better replicate future on-the-job tasks that tomorrowÆs workforce will face.  As STEM enrollments increase, this model utilizes the power of technology to facilitate research-based best practices in education.  It positions the STEM education community to take pedagogical advantage of increasingly available and increasingly affordable pen-enabled mobile computing devices. Although this project utilized Tablet PCs to facilitate the coupling, InkSurvey is now fully functional on a variety of devices (iPads, Android 4.0 and higher devices, etc.).
