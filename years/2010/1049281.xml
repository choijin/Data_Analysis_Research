<AbstractNarration>In the last few years, considerable attention has been focused on carbon capture and storage to mitigate anthropogenic input of atmospheric CO2. One proposed option for mitigation is to increase conversion of CO2 gas to stable, solid carbonate minerals during chemical weathering of tectonically exposed mantle rock (or peridotite). While natural carbonation of peridotite is commonly observed, its rate, and therefore the rate of CO2 uptake via this weathering mechanism, is poorly known. Determining the natural rate of peridotite carbonation is critical for understanding the influence of this potentially important ?sink? in the global carbon cycle. The natural peridotite carbonation rate is also an essential, but poorly constrained, parameter in calculations evaluating the viability of using artificially-enhanced, in situ alteration of peridotite to mitigate the buildup of anthropogenic input to atmospheric CO2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this research is to determine natural carbonation rates of exposed mantle peridotites. The Samail Ophiolite, Oman, is one of the largest and best-exposed ophiolites in the world, and hence is an ideal natural laboratory for investigating natural carbon storage in mantle peridotites. The research team has selected and carefully mapped eight sites that include roadcuts exposing carbonate veins, travertine deposits, and one site located on the natural peridotite weathering surface and containing abundant carbonate veins. The work plan consists of determining the ages of carbonates using two independent radiogenic dating techniques: 14C (for carbonates as old as ~50,000 years) and 238U-230Th (for carbonates as old as ~350,000 years). In addition, they will determine exposure ages for the host mantle peridotite to test the hypothesis that carbonate weathering primarily occurs in a thin weathering horizon that keeps pace with erosion rates. This project constitutes the Ph.D. thesis research for MIT/WHOI Joint Program student Evelyn Mervine. An improved understanding of natural carbonate formation in ultramafic rocks will aid efforts to develop CO2 capture and storage in ultramafic rocks to offset anthropogenic CO2 emissions and mitigate global climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this project was to determine the timescales of natural carbon sequestration through the formation of carbonate minerals during alteration of mantle peridotite. Mantle peridotites are mainly composed of the minerals olivine and pyroxene, which are far from equilibrium with H2O and CO2 on EarthÆs surface and are easily altered at low temperatures to secondary minerals, such as carbonates (calcite, magnesite, dolomite). However, the rate of this carbonation&mdash;and therefore the rate of CO2 uptake through this alteration mechanism&mdash;is poorly known. Determining the natural rate of peridotite carbonation is critical to assess the role of this potentially important "sink" in the global carbon cycle. It is also an essential, but poorly constrained, parameter in calculations evaluating the viability of using artificially enhanced, in situ alteration of peridotite to mitigate the buildup of anthropogenic input to atmospheric CO2.  We investigated rates of natural carbonation of peridotite in the Samail Ophiolite, Sultanate of Oman, which is one of the largest and best-exposed "ophiolites" (an uplifted fragment of oceanic crust and upper mantle now exposed sub-aerially) in the world. Our approach was to use a combination of field mapping, and two different age dating techniques (14C and 230Th-238U radiogenic dating) to determine carbonate formation ages.  We dated two types of carbonates: magnesite- and dolomite-rich subsurface veins that form in situ in peridotite, and calcite-rich travertines that precipitate from high-pH (10-12) surface waters.     Mg-rich veins sampled on the natural peridotite weathering surface range in age from 29,000-43,000 yr BP (average: 38,000 yr BP), consistent with previous studies. However, half of the Mg-rich veins sampled at roadcuts are older than 50,000 yr indicating formation over a considerably longer time period than previously estimated. In fact, two of the dolomite roadcut veins are &gt; 350,000 years old. Ca-rich carbonate veins, which are associated with calcite-rich surface travertine deposits, have younger ages ranging from ~5,000-24,000 yr BP (average: 16,000 yr BP). Surface travertines range in age from modern to &gt;45,000 yr BP, indicating unusually long-term deposition and preservation.     Based on our data, we calculate that approximately 1-3 x 106 kg CO2/yr is sequestered in Ca-rich surface travertines, and approximately 107 kg CO2/yr is sequestered in the Mg-rich carbonate veins. We also calculate the maximum rate of CO2 removal through erosion from cosmogenic 3He measurements to be 105-106 kg CO2/yr. Comparison of the carbonate formation and erosion rates indicates that the mantle peridotites of the Samail Ophiolite are a natural sink for CO2. However, the rate that CO2 is sequestered by this mechanism is small relative to the ~3.5 kg CO2/yr of anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere. Hence, the rates of CO2 uptake in peridotite would have to be greatly enhanced in order to significantly offset anthropogenic emissions.
