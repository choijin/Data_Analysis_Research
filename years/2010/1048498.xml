<AbstractNarration>1048498&lt;br/&gt;Ronney &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to help support travel and living expenses for about 25 graduate (and possibly undergraduate) students to attend the 33rd International Symposium on Combustion and present their research at that venue. All students supported by this grant will be (i) U.S. citizens or permanent residents (ii) Full-time Ph.D. students at an accredited U. S. university (iii) Supported by their academic advisor, as evidenced by a letter of recommendation, and (iv) An author or co-author of a contributed paper accepted by the Program Committee. NSF funds are targeted to increase the participation of graduate students at the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Combustion research is a multi-disciplinary field encompassing diverse disciplines in engineering and science. Society relies on combustion for power generation, transportation, and manufacturing. The combustion symposium provides a forum for international exchange of technical ideas. Policymakers will also be in attendance to participate in the exchange of information. The intellectual merit of this activity arises from the participation of international combustion experts from various countries, dissemination of their technical findings, their communications with students, and their visions of future research directions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Over 80% of the world's energy production and use is based on the combustion of fossil fuels. Combustion is ubiquitous in traditional energy conversion systems such as automotive engines, stationary and aircraft gas turbines, rocket and space propulsion, electrical power generation, industrial furnaces, and home and institutional space heating. Moreover, emerging technology areas such as hypersonic propulsion, micro scale power generation and material synthesis depend critically on chemically reacting flow processes. The world's dependence on combustion processes has led to many technological challenges including air quality, energy efficiency, global warming, and fire/explosion safety. Thus, combustion is an active, vital area of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 80% of the worldÆs energy production and use is based on the combustion of fossil fuels.  Combustion is ubiquitous in traditional energy conversion systems such as automotive engines, stationary and aircraft gas turbines, rocket and space propulsion, electrical power generation, industrial furnaces, and home and institutional space heating.  Moreover, emerging technology areas such as hypersonic propulsion, microscale power generation and material synthesis depend critically on chemically reacting flow processes.  The worldÆs dependence on combustion processes has led to many technological challenges including air quality, energy efficiency, global warming, and fire/explosion safety.  Thus, combustion is still an active, vital area of research.  Practically all of the most published, most cited and most respected members of the international combustion research community attend this Symposium.  Students attending this Symposium have a unique  opportunity to meet these members of the community, discuss their research with them, and exchange ideas with both senior researchers as well as their student peers from around the world.  Thus, it is almost essential that fledgling combustion researchers attend the Symposium and present their work therein.  The International Symposium on Combustion is by far the largest and most important international meeting for dissemination of combustion research results.  It is held biannually, in a different location each time.  The 33rd International Symposia on Combustion was held in Beijing, China, August 1 &ndash; 6, 2010.  This grant funded travel and living expenses for 18 graduate students to attend the 33rd Symposium and present their research at that venue.   All students supported by this grant were  U.S.      citizens or permanent residents Full-time      Ph.D. students at an accredited U. S. university Supported      by their academic advisor, as evidenced by a letter of recommendation An      author or co-author of a contributed paper accepted by the Program      Committee.   The funding provided by NSF was $20,000.  The breakdown of the funding was as follows:  Travel stipends:  18 stipends @ $1061.11 each          $19,100  Administrative fees ($50 per student)                                  $900  TOTAL                                                                                  $20,000   The assistance consisted of reimbursement of student early registration fees ($150) and $911.11 toward travel expenses.  18 qualified applications were received and all were supported.  The students funded were       Name     University       Colin Smith    University of Texas      Dan Haylett    Stanford University      Daniel Richardson    Purdue University      Casey M.
