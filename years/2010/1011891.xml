<AbstractNarration>Professor Chae S. Yi of Marquette University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of transition metal-catalyzed C-H bond activation reactions. Multinuclear ruthenium-hydride catalysts will be synthesized and used to achieve this objective. Another objective of the proposed research is to design and use chiral ruthenium-oxazoline catalysts for the asymmetric C-H bond oxidation reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalytic C-H bond oxidation reactions are extensively used for the industrial production of oxygenated compounds from ubiquitous hydrocarbon compounds. The proposed research will contribute to our knowledge in homogenous catalysis, and will advance the development of energy efficient and environmentally compatible catalysts for important industrial processes. Students at Marquette University will be trained in organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis and will be exposed to an international exchange experience in chemical catalysis. Minority students from Alcorn State University and the local community colleges in Milwaukee will be involved in this research.</AbstractNarration>
