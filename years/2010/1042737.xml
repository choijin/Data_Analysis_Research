<AbstractNarration>This planning visit is to use monitoring data collected from various structural systems in Korea in order to apply, validate, and test non-parametric methodologies. Without a priori information or physical assumptions on the structures of interest, which requires expensive field/laboratory measurements, non-parametric methodologies can be used to make useful engineering judgments using data from a minimal number of sensors. Unlike the US, the monitoring of important civil infrastructure in Korea is mandated by laws, and access to our Korean counterparts? rich data pools will be important to developing and validating the methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This visit and the ensuing research efforts will positively impact how voluminous sensor data can be meaningfully and accurately interpreted. Its importance is highly emphasized in the current development of the Long-Term Bridge Performance (LTBP) Program by FHWA and the Landslide Hazards Program by USGS. This planning visit is to catalyze international research collaborations, and it is expected to yield ongoing research ventures in the near future. Monitoring civil infrastructure using sensor-based instrumentation is highly multi-disciplinary, and the graduate student involved in this planning visit will have a unique opportunity of being exposed to real-life needs of multi-disciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

The current condition of U.S. infrastructure is rated "D" according the 2009 ASCE Report Cards for AmericaÆs Civil Infrastructure. A grand challenge is that the current infrastructure management approach is not sustainable. The estimated cost to improve the deficient U.S. infrastructure system has increased approximately double for last ten years: $1.3 trillion in 2001, $1.6 trillion in 2003, and $2.2 trillion in 2009. Aging civil infrastructure is calling for urgent measures focusing on maintenance, repair, and renovation.  For sustainable and resilient next-generation infrastructure systems with high long-term performance, it is imperative to develop better design, prediction, maintenance, life-cycle-cost-analysis and decision-making methodologies, and the success is premised up on the understanding of complicated long-term deterioration mechanisms of structures under various field conditions. Sensor-based instrumentation techniques coupled with Internet-enabled data communication techniques are commonly employed to obtain necessary quantitative measures of the progressive degradation of structures over time.
