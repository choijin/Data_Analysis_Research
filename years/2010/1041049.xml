<AbstractNarration>The multiphasic chemistry of halogens is known to be involved in a range of chemical interactions in the atmosphere ranging from the O3 cycle, oxidation of hydrocarbons and reduced sulphur compounds, the odd nitrogen and oxygen (HOx and NOx) cycles, as well as involvement in aerosol nucleation, growth and heterogeneous chemical paths. Active halogen reactivity is frequently associated with coastal or marine zones, reflecting the abundance of oceanic halide sources found there. Recent nocturnal observations of the reactivity of a chlorine atom precursor, nitryl chloride (ClNO2) has seemed to predict a surprising continental presence of this pathway, which potentially has implications to our understanding of the global impact of halogens on several of the above species in non-marine settings. Nocturnal ClNO2 arises from the reactivity of N2O5 on particulate chloride, which brings into question how well continental chloride sources including industrial activity, biomass burning, and the transport of wind blown mineral dust are really known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several aspects of the above suspected chlorine activation pathways remain to be investigated. This investigation involves a number of university researchers joining with NOAA (ESRL) colleagues on additional characterization of halogen reactivity pathways in continental air masses. Overarching issues to be investigated include: i) quantitative evaluation of halogen photochemical processes in continental air, ii) mechanistic study of the generation and recycling of active halogen chemistry in nocturnal continental air.&lt;br/&gt;This research has implications for air quality, the natural cycle of halogens in the atmsphere and the oxidative capacity of the air we breathe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In February and March 2011, we joined NOAA scientists and other colleagues from around the nation, as well as from Canada and Germany in Erie, Colorado to take part in a month-long air chemistry study with implications for both climate and air quality.     The Nitrogen, Aerosol Composition, and Halogens on a Tall Tower (NACHTT) study conducted at NOAAÆs Boulder Atmospheric Observatory was an effort to decipher why and how the compound nitryl chloride, which is usually associated with the atmosphere near oceans, also forms during the winter nighttime in land-locked regions like the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Reactions with a variety of airborne contaminants, including smoke from wood burning, pollution from power plants, and road de-icing chemicals, are among the suspects.     Nitryl chloride breaks apart quickly as the sun rises to release chlorine atoms. Chlorine atoms can react with many other compounds, contributing to smog formation, and can also influence chemical cycles that destroy or produce various greenhouse gases, including ozone and methane. The chlorine essentially acts as an accelerant for the photochemistry that leads to ozone production and for the reactions that consume methane. Nighttime formation of nitryl chloride is a gateway to forming more highly reactive chlorine atoms. This "active chlorine" chemistry changes the atmosphereÆs starting point for ozone production the next day.     We collaborated closely with Prof. William Keene of the University of Virginia to study the role that soluble gases and aerosol particle composition play in the appearance of nitryl chloride. We employed several instruments, some of which were custom built, to study soluble gases like hydrochloric acid and ammonia, and aerosol particle composition.
