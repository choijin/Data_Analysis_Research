<AbstractNarration>PI: Gary Stacey (University of Missouri)&lt;br/&gt;Co-PIs: Jianlin Cheng (University of Missouri) and Dong Xu (University of Missouri)&lt;br/&gt;Collaborators: David Koppenaal (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) and Ljiljana Pa?a-Toliæ (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems biology is the comprehensive, quantitative analysis of the manner in which all components of a biological system interact. The ultimate goal is a new, predictive view of cellular function, supplanting the older descriptive understanding. However, even with the availability of advanced technologies, systems biology has yet to achieve its promise due to a variety of issues, not the least of which is the overall complexity of biological systems. The project reduces this complexity by studying the response of a single, plant cell type, the root hair, to infection by the beneficial nitrogen fixing bacterium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The current project builds on past work that has developed the soybean root hair cell as an ideal model for genomic study. The goal is to focus specifically on the regulatory networks that control the infection process leading to the successful establishment of a nitrogen fixing symbiosis. Beyond its relevance to systems biology, the work promises to yield new insights into plant cellular function, root development and the nitrogen fixation process, which is of great agronomic and ecological importance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The root hair is the first site of plant response to bacteria during the nitrogen fixation process. Therefore, identifying the plant response pathways at a systems level could provide new avenues for manipulating nitrogen fixation in crop plants. The project will yield sequence data that will be made publicly available through GenBank and through our project website (www.soyroothair.org), as well as the Soybean Knowledgebase (www.SoyKB.org). The latter is being designed as a comprehensive resource to house, visualize and analyze all types of soybean functional genomic data. The project has a substantial outreach and educational component that partners with the University to address K-12, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Current predictions suggest that the earthÆs population could exceed 9 billion people by mid-century. This creates a major challenge for agriculture to increase the worldÆs food supply. The increases in crop yield that have occurred over the past decades can be largely attributed to the increasing use of industrially produced nitrogen fertilizer, which now requires roughly 2% of world energy use. Production of these fertilizers increases use of fossil fuels and can also be detrimental to the environment due to nitrogen pollution from fertilizer runoff. What is needed is a more sustainable, environmentally friendly approach, while supporting a continuing increase in the amount and quality of food.     Legumes, such as soybean, have the ability to fix nitrogen directly from the air through a root symbiosis with soil bacteria, termed rhizobia. However, this symbiosis is not present in many of our important crops; such as, corn, rice, and wheat.

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in engineering approaches to transfer symbiotic nitrogen fixation from legumes to such crops. In order to make this practical, we first need a detailed, mechanistic understanding of how rhizobia infect and establish a symbiosis with their host plant. Only with this information can we know what essential traits must be transferred to establish a nitrogen fixing symbiosis in new crops. Such studies are complicated by the fact that only relatively few cells in a legume...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
