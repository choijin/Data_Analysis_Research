<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a 600 MHz 4-channel NMR instrument with a cryoprobe. The new spectrometer will be housed in the Stony Brook University NMR center and will be operated as a user run instrument on a fee for service basis.  Projects supported by the new instrument span the range from chemical biology to protein folding, protein dynamics, studies of DNA structure, the characterization of novel carbon rich molecules and the design of novel polymers.  The new NMR is thus an essential resource for university-wide efforts in Chemical Biology, Structural Biology, and Materials Science. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows use the NMR during the course of their research. Thus, the spectrometer also supports the training of the next generation of researchers in modern state-of-the-art NMR methods.  Furthermore, Stony Brook is exceptionally aggressive about including undergraduates in research. Participants in Project WISE, a university wide initiative designed to support and mentor undergraduate women in science utilize the NMR, amongst a range of other outreach programs.  The results of these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
