<AbstractNarration>There is increasing evidence that cross disciplinary collaboration spurs  innovation and helps solve pressing scientific problems. This workshop advances understanding on how, when, where, and for whom interdisciplinary collaboration works, and when it does not. The experts attending the workshop span the social science disciplines of cognitive psychology, social psychology, organizational behavior, economics, anthropology, sociology, and science/technology studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The workshop provides an overview of the state of the art across disciplines of the science of interdisciplinary collaboration, as well as specific gaps in theory, constructs, data, and methods. The workshop also provides an opportunity for cross-fertilization, communication, and innovation to occur among the social scientists themselves. The approach documents ways in which interdisciplinary collaboration can be more effectively studied, including addressing complex measurement and conceptual issues as well as ways in which infrastructure can be created and maintained.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broder Impact: The US is facing serious challenges in the fields of science and technology. The results of the workshop inform the structure of science and engineering education: as ways of composing, structuring, and instructing teams are examined. In addition, the workshop's explicit goal is the generation of a structure that could help drive new, innovative research.&lt;br/&gt;The audience is extremely broad - spanning social science disciplines and having practical and policy implications for other scientists and engineers. The results of the workshop are also broadly disseminated through a workshop website, executive summary and link to the website in professional newsletters and publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report, NSF 1047728     August 2, 2011     Principal Investigators: Susannah Paletz and Laurel Smith-Doerr     Innovation is vital to a healthy national economy. Cross-functional and multidisciplinary teams help create some of our most popular products, from the iPod (software, hardware, user-researchers) to new medical devices. In addition, innovation across multiple disciplines is essential for solving some of the countryÆs most pressing problems, from fixing a ruptured oil well on the ocean floor to providing clean energy sources. Science and engineering teams are, as a result, increasingly interdisciplinary. Funding agencies have recognized that solving complex problems often requires teams from multiple disciplines. However, cross-disciplinary teams are faced with obstacles from psychological, interpersonal, team, cultural, and institutional sources.

Even more importantly, it can be difficult to integrate the literature on this topic into a useful whole.   In order to address these issues, a two-day National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored workshop titled æInterdisciplinary Collaboration in Innovative Science and Engineering FieldsÆ was held in November 2010 at Boston University.

It was not considered necessary to merge all disciplines into one coherent approach to interdisciplinarity, but there was widely shared curiosity about the research questions, methods, findings, and approaches from different fields.
