<AbstractNarration>This proposal on energy materiality seeks to create an entirely new framing and participatory citizen engagement with energy, not solely as a producer-consumer model, but to directly introduce and operationalize novel strategies for engaging, making, sharing, saving, and expressing personal, interactive micro-energy.  This proposal will develop an alternative perspective on energy- as-materiality and propose a series of design approaches for materializing energy and introduce additional concepts, such as: energy mementos, energy attachment, energy engagement, energy attunement, local energy, seasonal energy, and energy meta-data. This proposal is specifically focused on advancing the knowledge around novel energy production, sharing, and economics by positioning citizens in the role of active participants in these operations. While the scale of energy may initially be small, the potential for new, creative thinking and citizen led grassroots energy efforts to emerge and develop into impactful everyday energy solutions is very real. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal leverages citizen creativity and participation in concepts of energy production, expression, sharing, and usage.  This proposal directly engages with underrepresented groups in this debate - namely non-experts across a range of communities. The potential impact can be as simple as introducing strategies and techniques for energy problem solving and ideation using citizens and novel artifacts. This proposal will encourage improved energy literacy in people and draw non-experts into the energy solution debate as active participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal focused on developing an entirely new framing and participatory citizen engagement with energy.   More specifically, this grant focused on advancing the knowledge around novel energy production, sharing, and economics by positioning citizens in the role of active participants in these systems.  While many of the final designs and prototypes centered around small scale quantities of energy, the primary research questions were around introducing and evaluating a set of new relationships and interactive experiences surrounding energy.    The initial work in this grant evaluated a range of existing energy monitoring and feedback systems commonly found in domestic settings.  Our findings highlighted the ineffectiveness of such systems across a range of everyday usage conditions.  Primarily it exposed how existing interfaces are often unpersuasive in communicating energy conservation and lacked mechanisms for building strong emotional ties to energy usage. Moreover, habits often dominated an individualÆs behavior, even when influenced by monetary or other incentives.    Leveraging this insight, this grant explored a series of designs that exposed the materiality of energy to users without explicitly guilting or rewarding any particular energy usage behavior.  The research strategy was to enable novel experiences, connections, and opportunities for individuals to collect, share, and experience, energy.  These experiences were specifically designed to invite users to encounter energy in new ways and develop resulting behaviors based on this "new ways of seeing".  This was achieved through a series of functional prototypes that were built and evaluated with users in situ.  These included new domestic experiences for improved appliance interfaces using metaphors such as "cutting, trimming, switching, upgrading, and shifting" to projects such as the "Local Energy Indicator" that exposing the availability of alternative energy such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric to users.  These later approaches improved individualsÆ conceptualization of energy usage and promoted more participatory solutions to energy conservation.   The grant also more directly explored design concepts around energy materially through functional prototypes such as the "Energy Mementos" and "Energy Parasites".  The Energy Mementos explicitly researched and evaluated specific types of human powered interactive micro-energy generation techniques. While the energy produced was small, the interactive experiences of production, sharing, and saving of the energy were critically designed and studied.  Associating meta-data, crowd sourcing, and tangibility around the production of energy, enabled important new insights into the best practices for new designs, affordances, and interfaces to energy systems.   This included the award winning "Energy Parasites" which were demonstrated widely as a series of functional designs for rethinking and exposing energy across public urban landscapes.  During this work, concepts around emotional and personal associations to energy emerged as primary drivers for energy awareness, literacy, education, and conservation.  A final resulting public artifact was the development of a local energy mobile app that used time and location information to determine the electrical power source(s) being used during battery charging (i.e. coal, hydro, nuclear, etc) and visualized the resulting electrical mix on the userÆs mobile device.    The later phases of the grant developed a more generalizable theory of design practice beyond the "Energy Materiality" framing into a broader range of applications and technologies. This work resulted in the "Counter Functionality" methodology for enabling useful, alternative designs of digital products and devices based on constraint driven design inversions. We designed, built, and evaluated a series of "counter functional" devices using this approach.    In summary, this grant enabled a series of valuable...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
