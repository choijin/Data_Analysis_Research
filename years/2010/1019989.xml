<AbstractNarration>Even a rather small population of bacteria may contain millions of cells that undergo several generations every day.  As a result, bacteria can quickly evolve and adapt to their environments.  In this renewal project, the investigators will propagate, monitor, preserve, and study populations of Escherichia coli while they evolve in a defined laboratory environment for five years, bringing the duration of this long-term experiment to over 60,000 cell generations.  To measure the adaptation of the bacteria, the researchers allow the evolved bacteria to compete against their ancestral strain.  The researchers also compare these adaptive dynamics with changes in genome sequences in order to elucidate the rates, mechanisms, and predictability of bacterial evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project offers a unique opportunity to observe and quantify the process of evolution owing to the speed with which the bacteria evolve and the careful design of this long-term experiment.  At the same time, bacteria are extremely important in several respects: as essential players in ecosystem processes, as agents of disease in humans and many other species, and as workhorses in biotechnology.  Therefore, in-depth knowledge about the rates, mechanisms, and outcomes of bacterial evolution has many important implications and applications for science and society. The scientific aims and findings of this on-going research project have been and will be presented to the public via outreach activities including interviews with journalists, seminars for non-specialists, and web-based presentations hosted by the NSF and other outlets. Biological samples and datasets generated by this study will continue to be shared with the scientific community, including genome sequences placed in public repositories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many bacterial species replicate quickly and reach large population sizes.  As a result, they can change and adapt on a time scale that can be observed and measured.  PI Richard Lenski and his team at Michigan State University have watched and studied 12 populations of E. coli bacteria as they evolve in a laboratory environment for the past five years, bringing the duration of this long-term experiment past 60,000 generations.   To measure the process of adaptation by natural selection, the researchers competed bacteria from different generations against the ancestral strain.  Fitness, as measured by growth during the competition assays, continued to increase throughout this experiment.  Although the rate of improvement slowed down over time, the bacteriaÆs growth did not reach an upper limit.  Instead, the data are consistent with a mathematical model, called a power law, which predicts that bacterial fitness can increase without limit, but at a rate that steadily declines as they become more and more fit.  To identify the genetic changes in the evolving populations, the researchers sequenced the complete genomes of many bacteria from different populations and time points and compared them to the ancestorÆs genome.  These sequences revealed the mutations responsible for the ability to consume citrate, a function that evolved in one population.  Genome sequences also showed the effects of changes in the mutation rate itself, which can evolve as a consequence of mutations that affect DNA repair and related functions.    This experiment provides a special opportunity to observe and quantify the process of evolution.  Bacteria are important in many respects: as essential players in ecosystem processes, as agents of disease in humans and other species, and as workhorses in biotechnology.  Therefore, acquiring new knowledge about the rates, mechanisms, and outcomes of bacterial evolution has important implications and potential applications for science and society.   This project has provided biological samples used in research conducted by a diverse team of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists working with the PI.  Thus, it contributes to developing the nationÆs scientific workforce.  Also, some findings from this project were reported by journalists, thereby helping to promote the publicÆs understanding of science.
