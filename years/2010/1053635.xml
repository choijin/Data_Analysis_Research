<AbstractNarration>1053635&lt;br/&gt;Rodriguez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of instrumentation to remotely measure gas species, mainly SO2, aerosols and particles in volcanic plumes.  Specific equipment to be acquired includes: 1) a Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer (DOAS) configured with an automated scanning system for measurement and quantification of fluxes of gas species (e.g., SO2, Nox and O3); 2) a UV spectrometer and UV camera for determination of SO2 emission rates 3) a sun photometer for measurement of the spectral optical depth of plumes to infer aerosol particle size distribution; 4) a portable weather station to help in determining plume speeds and assessing meteorological conditions; 5) a deposit impactor for direct sampling of volcanic aerosols; and 5) ancillary field and portable computer equipment.  The equipment will support PI internationally collaborative research and student research training with a focus on assessment of gas and aerosol emissions from active volcanoes in Central America and Mexico.   Ground-based measurements will complement and help to validate use of spaceborne remote sensing data from MODIS, ASTER etc. to observe active volcanic systems and study their dynamics.  Facilitated research will have direct implications for assessing and mitigating volcanic hazards and for improving our understanding of the effects of volcanic emissions on climate.  The PI is  an early career female geoscientist and the University of Puerto Rico is a Hispanic Serving Institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

was to acquire new instrumentation to be used in research projects and educational activities at the Department of Geology, University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez Campus (UPRM).&nbsp; In the grant period a number of high quality instruments were acquired, including a Resonance Expedition Mini-DOAS system, a FLYSPEC spectrometer system, an ultraviolet (UV) camera, two sun photometers, a FLIR A35 camera, a drone, and direct sampling materials, to measure gas species (especially sulfur dioxide, SO<sub>2</sub>) and particles (and their distributions) in a volcanic plume.&nbsp; Other accessories and materials were also acquired through the grant.&nbsp; No such instrumentation existed at the University of Puerto Rico, which is the only institution that graduates Geology students in Puerto Rico, about 98% of which are Hispanic and about 60% are women.&nbsp; The research objectives of the grant included the determination of baseline fluxes of SO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to the atmosphere from different volcanoes in Latin America, especially Guatemala and Peru.&nbsp; The ground-based measurements have also been compared to results obtained from the analysis of satellite data, especially from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), which can be used to determine SO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;mass and flux in the volcanic plumes.&nbsp; The images also complement our data in terms of constraining the plume direction and other changes in plume geometry downwind.&nbsp; The instruments acquired for gas and aerosol monitoring help us obtain a complete picture of the volcanic plume, both close to the vent and downwind.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The award has allowed the PI to expose undergraduate and graduate students to different volcano monitoring techniques directly, as part of volcanology courses and/or workshops, as well as during hands-on field experiences.&nbsp; About 28 undergraduate and graduate students participated in a field trip in 2012 to Costa Rica in which demonstrations of the instrumentation and its use were made at Irazu volcano.&nbsp; Three undergraduate students and 3 graduate students participated in field campaigns to Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Peru, and therefore received individual training in the acquisition of data with the UV spectrometers and the UV camera.&nbsp; One of these graduate students is currently working on her master&rsquo;s thesis research, which is focused on the SO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;gas emissions from the active volcanoes of Guatemala.&nbsp; Her research data were collected during field campaigns in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, using the instruments acquired with this grant.&nbsp;Other undergraduate and graduate students will participate in future field campaigns and they will process and analyze the data obtained with the different instruments.&nbsp; The target volcanoes in this research have included the three main active volcanoes in Guatemala (Fuego, Santiaguito, and Pacaya), three active volcanoes in Peru (Sabancaya, Ubinas, and Misti), and Turrialba volcano, in Costa Rica.&nbsp; All these volcanoes are either in eruptive periods or have had recent eruptive events.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>National and international research collaborations have been established or have continued since the start of the grant, with 6 field campaigns to different countries (Guatemala 2013-2016, Costa Rica 2012, and Peru 2015) and other activities. &nbsp;Among these activities the PI was invited to participate in an international workshop in Guatemala: <em>Workshop on Volcanoes 2016</em>, at Santiaguito volcano, Guatemala, and she gave a presentation about ground-based techniques for volcanic gas monitoring, as well as demonstration activities for the participants.&nbsp; The PI was also invited to present at a public forum at the Universidad de San Carlos, in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, which is the second largest city in Guatemala and the one closest to the Santiaguito volcano.&nbsp; She gave a presentation titled&nbsp;<em>Monitoreo volc&aacute;nico usando sensores remotos</em>, to a group of over 150 geology students and faculty from different universities in Guatemala.&nbsp; The collaborations have always included training on the acquisition and processing of the data for the local volcanologists, students, observers, and members of the community.&nbsp; The acquisition of the instrumentation has also opened up opportunities for new collaborations, such as a formal collaboration with the Universidad Catolica del Norte, in Antofagasta, Chile, for studies on SO<sub>2</sub> gas emissions and seismicity at Lascar volcano, Chile, which will be starting at the end of November-December 2016.&nbsp; We have also shared the results of our research with the local collaborators and have included them as co-authors in presentations.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/19/2016<br>      Modified by: Lizzette&nbsp;A&nbsp;Rodriguez</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1053635/1053635_10133522_1479583218887_Figure6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1053635/1053635_10133522_1479583218887_Figure6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Measurements at Fuego volcano - 2014"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1053635/1053635_10133522_1479583218887_Figure6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Measurements at Fuego volcano - 2014"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Setup of the Resonance Expedition system at Fuego volcano on April 10, 2014, during vertical scans of the plume.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lizzette A.
