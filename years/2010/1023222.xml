<AbstractNarration>Scientists who study the evolution of specialized bodies, behaviors, and the brains that drive them, need to know about ever increasing numbers and varieties of specimens and data that are becoming available, and how to gain access to them. To promote this learning, a conference is being held where researchers and students will share information about world resources of specimens and data, especially those that are not well publicized.  Investigators will exhibit the latest in technology for learning about brains and related behaviors, along with novel and often surprising findings, obtained using new techniques including brain scans, analyses of gene structure and expression, intracellular and intercellular transport of markers and physiologically active molecules, studies of fossils, electrophysiological probes, programmed observing and recording individual and social behaviors in wild natural surroundings, and digital capture and dissemination of images and numerical information. &lt;br/&gt; This opportunity for personal interactions among generations of workers, including new students and established authorities, will have lasting benefits for the work of all of them. The impact will be further spread by the publication of the Conference Proceedings in an established archival publication, the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, available in most of the major libraries of the world as well as on the Internet. The Conference Proceedings will be a major reference source for students, scientists, schools, industry, and public knowledge, for information about, and new means of studying, the relationships among the specializations of brains, bodily structures, and behaviors that enable, not only survival in particular environments, but, increasingly, the managing of environments themselves through the behaviors of their animal and human inhabitants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference on New Studies in Neurobehavioral Evolution held on June 25-28, 2010 in Washington D. C., at the National Museum of Health and Medicine, was convened to show the influence of the life work of Wally Welker, an outstanding student of the evolutionary relationships of specializations of brains and behavior of mammals.  Both at the conference itself, and in the two published volumes of proceedings of the conference, the history and value of this influence are summarized.   In the first of these volumes, published as the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences issue of April 2011, vol. 1225, studies in fields of WelkerÆs major contributions are presented. These include the importance of observing developmental aspects of brain-behavior relationships; documentation of the elaboration of distinctive sensorimotor circuits to enable behavioral adaptations to, and manipulations of, novel environments; morphological correlates of advanced cerebral circuitry; and the invention, as a result of evolutionary processes, of more complex levels of perception and behavioral exploitation of distinctive environments. These include the emergence in evolution of what we know as an autonomous mind, along with other intellectual capabilities.  These contemporary studies have been conducted by WelkerÆs colleagues, by his and their students, by students of the students, and by others from different backgrounds carrying out related current investigations.  The second volume, published as Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences issue of May 2011, vol. 1225 S, features current work regarding two of WelkerÆs principles and contributions to this field: 1) the importance of gathering anatomical, physiological and behavioral data from a wide but orderly diversity of animal forms, and 2) the employment of the latest technological developments. The volume presents a survey of the history and contents of the outstanding brain collection that Welker assembled and publicized, and those of several other such assemblies that he was instrumental in amalgamating into a single national resource. Along with this there is presented an intercontinental survey of other such groupings of resources, so as to provide a world resource listing, that modern technological resources can make available to everyone world-wide the data contained in these varied, multiform and diverse resources. Other contents of the volume introduce new uses of imaging and other technologies for the study of brain evolution.  The conference served as a significant vehicle in advancing the training of a new generation of researchers, teachers, and publicists in advancing concepts and techniques for furthering understanding of brain functions and their relations to animal and human behaviors.  The surveys of international resources for comparative brain study that are presented in these Proceedings constitute a major resource for researchers and educators.  Public understanding of brain-behavior relationships, and the importance for human welfare of preservation, study, and research about behavioral evolution, will inform public and corporate thinking about natural resources and educational investments.  The Conference was sponsored and supported by The National Museum of Health and Medicine; NeuroScience Associates Inc., Knoxville TN; Michigan State University Radiology Department, Division of Anatomy; National Science Foundation Grant 1023222; and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Grant R13N5071771.
