<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 July 2010&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1019806&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Miami&lt;br/&gt;PI:   R. Kniffin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V WALTON SMITH operated by the University of Miami; namely stern A-frame repairs, anchor windlass design and installation, electronic navigation system up-grades, and analysis of the vessel?s deck bolting pattern.  All of the items requested will either improve safety or enhance the science support capability of the vessel.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The R/V WALTON SMITH  supports federally funded scientific research in the southern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events, and educational cruises.  The WALTON SMITH  is scheduled to complete approximately 100 NSF sponsored days in 2010.</AbstractNarration>

Swivel pole mount system &ndash; There is often a need to mount a science party supplied transducer on a pole alongside the ship. In the past we had a pole that we literally bolted to the side of the ship using clamps. It was necessary to hang someone over the side in a bosonÆs chair to do this so if it was rough or at night we could not do it. A swivel pole mount system allows the pole to swivel from horizontal to vertical on a pin with very little effort. This is a custom designed and installed system that works very well and has been a very valuable addition to the ships capabilities.
