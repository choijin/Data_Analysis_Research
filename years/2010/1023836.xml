<AbstractNarration>Crossing Borders: The Fenians and the Transatlantic Crisis over Citizenship&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study investigates a major shift in citizenship policy in the mid-nineteenth century: for the first time, the United States, England and several other countries explicitly recognized the right of expatriation, that is, the individual?s right to give up his citizenship and pledge allegiance to a new sovereign.  Scholars tend to consider the state?s use of immigration and citizenship laws to govern entrance to the country and admission as citizens.  This study argues that ?rules of exit? ? laws that regulated the right to leave a country and to renounce one?s native allegiance ? were just as important as immigration laws in deploying state strategies for managing populations, forging national identities, and building modern nation states.  The expatriation crisis of the 19th century ushered in modern conceptions of citizenship which privileged the will of the individual in choosing to leave and swear allegiance to the sovereign of one?s choice. In explaining the factors which thrust expatriation onto the agenda of national and international policymakers, the study focuses on the role of transnational political actors, particularly Irish American nationalists and international law experts, who, despite their unofficial status, proved to be catalysts in securing domestic legislation and international treaties on expatriation. While the work is primarily historical in its method, the author also draws upon the rich social scientific literature on the mobilization of law, legal consciousness, and migration and sovereignty studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research highlights the development of many modern concepts in immigration policy-making and the historical role of non-governmental organizations in developing these concepts. Many of the ideas unleashed by the expatriation crisis of the 1860s continue to inform and shape current controversies around immigration policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study investigates a major shift in citizenship policy in the mid-nineteenth century:  for the first time, the United States, England and several other countries explicitly recognized the right of expatriation, that is, the individualÆs right to give up his citizenship and pledge allegiance to a new sovereign. Expatriation, as a political concept, had revolutionary  potential; it emphasized the power of individuals to choose their political homes. Yet, despite contemporariesÆ views of the revolutionary nature of these legal changes&ndash;and the intense public interest in expatriation at the time-- the history of expatriation has received relatively little scholarly attention and the "right of expatriation" has largely become a forgotten right.  Today, "expatriation" most often refers to losing rather than choosing citizenship.   Similarly, scholars tend to focus on the stateÆs use of  immigration and citizenship laws to govern entrance to the country and admission as citizens. This study argues that "rules of exit" &ndash; laws that regulated the right to leave a country and to renounce oneÆs native allegiance &ndash; were just as important as immigration laws in deploying state strategies for managing populations, forging national identities, and building modern nation states.   I pose two central questions: 1) Why, in the late 1860s, did expatriation suddenly become a heated international issue? and  2) Why did the "right of expatriation" become eclipsed in the 20th century, replaced by an understanding of expatriation as the involuntary loss of citizenship?  I argue that three major factors  made expatriation a viable issue in the late 1860s.  First, mass migration to the United States beginning in the 1840s created new transnational political actors with a significant stake in establishing a right of expatriation.  Second, international law experts  formed transatlantic networks to provide a new intellectual framework which made expatriation appear not only just, but also advantageous to the interests of emerging nation states.  And third, the consolidation of modern nation states in the United States and Europe  brought questions of citizenship and national sovereignty to the forefront.  Ultimately, as states seized upon expatriation as a tool to manage mobile populations, individuals wielded increasingly less control over their political allegiances.    While primarily a work of history, the project speaks to fundamental questions about political membership in the modern nation state, asking who decides who belongs, and on what terms?  And what obligations does membership create, for the nation state as well as for the citizen? Such questions became particularly thorny in the nineteenth century as unprecedented numbers of individuals left their homes to emigrate to new countries, but they continue to challenge contemporary global societies.  The expansion of global and transnational perspectives has been important to socio-legal studies and is at the core of migration studies. In focusing on how modern nation states have grappled with citizens leaving and regulated their right to relinquish their citizenship, the study helps to put modern developments in expatriation within a longer trajectory.  It also helps to highlight the long history of what some modern scholars have called a "transnational civil society," that is, the key role played by private individuals in helping to shape domestic and international policies.  Finally, the study sheds light on why policies have "traction" in domestic and international political spheres at particular times, and the role that individuals, organizations, and communication networks have in mobilizing particular policy initiatives.  Contemporary scholarship, for example, emphasizes the role that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have played in shaping, monitoring and implementing a wide variety of programs. The nineteenth century study reveals the significant role that non...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
