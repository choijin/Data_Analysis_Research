<AbstractNarration>1041726&lt;br/&gt;Levine&lt;br/&gt;This award, to deploy a unique, large, shared memory machine to the science and engineering community, will dramatically increase the size of a heavily oversubscribed TeraGrid resource. The new resource, an SGI UV system with two direcly addressible 16 TB memory banks will be used by a significant group of researchers whose codes cannot efficiently run on the large distributed-memory machines. The SGI UV system will increase the available cycles by more than a factor of 7 compared to current resources.</AbstractNarration>
