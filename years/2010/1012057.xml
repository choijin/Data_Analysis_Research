<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will provide support for graduate students and postdocs to travel to Korea to attend the International Winter School:  Beyond Moore?s Law.  The project is modeled after the Advanced Study Institutes conducted around the world on various subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits &lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an outstanding educational opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to examine and overcome the fundamental and technological challenges encountered in the continuing the miniaturization of modern microelectronic devices.  Emphasis will be placed on novel nanoelectronic technologies that depart significant from scaling of conventional field-effect transistors.  The speakers, all leading scholars in their fields, will be recruited from Asia, the US, and Europe.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The organizers will stress interactions between graduate students, postdocs, and international faculty, to ensure that junior scientists have ample opportunity to meet not only current leaders in their fields, but also develop contacts among their international peers for potential future collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
