<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposed project is to provide students with both financial and academic support to improve the educational outcomes and retention rates of low-income students in science majors at the University of Rochester.  The project expands the support currently available for low-income students in the sciences and math to improve outcomes in three areas critical to educational advancement: retention to major declaration, academic improvement over time, and degree attainment.  The students are participating in various activities such as intensive advising, study group sessions and tutoring in gateway courses, and a high level of faculty interaction. The project increases the numbers of low-income students who declare a science or math major and go on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in the targeted fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF STEM project provided summer scholarships, academic year scholarships and study group support for STEM intended students who demonstrated financial need; additionally, we provided access to resources that support student success in STEM, including a dedicated staff that works with each scholar individually. Together, they develop and sustain a strong academic plan designed to ensure persistence towards on-time graduation in STEM.  Major Activities:  Activity #1 Scholarships  Existing scholarship students were provided with scholarships of $2,000 for the academic year as freshman and sophomores. These scholarships were provided in $1,000 increments for each semester. The total cost per student was  $4,000 over 2 years. These scholarships were used to offset unmet financial need, or to replace self-help such as student loans. Although small in amount, the scholarships had a positive impact on student retention and feeling of belonging.     Activity #2 &ndash; Chemistry Workshops  Chemistry Workshops are an opportunity for students to work in small groups (~5) for 90 minutes, twice a week with a graduate student leader. The purpose of these meetings is to review class materials and practice problems for first and second-year chemistry sequences: General (131 &amp; 132) and Organic (203 &amp; 204) Chemistry. The content for these workshops is developed each week by the graduate student leader, keeping in mind the strengths and weaknesses of the group. Staff from the Office of Minority Student Affairs, the David T. Kearns Center and our faculty PI monitor all groups. There are regular meetings after each exam for assessing studentsÆ aptitude and performance and sharing ways to improve the groups. This has resulted in the building of a community of teacher/scholars, who know how to work with diverse students and have a range of different learning styles and approaches. Also, students understand that they are not invisible, that staff and faculty care about their performance, and will work with them to develop appropriate strategies for academic success. We have continued this activity in our no-cost extension period, and have institutionalized it moving forward, both in chemistry and in introductory biology.     Activity #3 Summer Courses  Students were allowed to take up to 2 STEM courses in the summer, preferably between the first and second-year. While enrolled, students are required to attend study hall with a graduate student from the registered courseÆs department for support with course assignments. STEM funds were used to partially offset the cost of tuition and textbooks. Previously, no mechanism existed that allowed any student to take courses without cost over summer. The Kearns Center provides housing and a meal allowance for students, which allows them to focus entirely on their academic work. We have institutionalized summer support, and currently there are 30 first year STEM students approved to remain on campus during the summer to complete a STEM course and therefore be on track for on time graduation.     Activity #4 &ndash; Book Allowance  STEM scholars were able to receive support for textbook purchasing during their tenure here are the university. Each semester, we either purchase or lend textbooks to scholars. Overtime we have built a library of over 250 STEM textbooks through multiple initiatives. All purchased or lent books are returned at the end of each semester.     Activity #5 &ndash; Learning Community and Workshop Activities  Each of our STEM scholars are enrolled in a seminar course that meets weekly during the spring semester of their freshman year when they are admitted into the program. This seminar is designed to introduce them to the scholarship program and to help them understand their responsibility as scholars committed to academic excellence. As a part of this experience students engage in intensive work on their study skills and metacognition to get a sense of what ways they learn be...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
