<AbstractNarration>The Western Antarctic Peninsula, a highly productive region of the Southern Ocean, is experiencing considerable changes as a result of warming.  Productivity in this region is microbially-driven, and, as recently documented for nearly every other aquatic system, viruses are likely to have significant effects on the diversity, function, and activity of these microorganisms. A study of the relative importance and genomic content of lytic and temperate viral assemblages is proposed. Lytic and temperate viral infections are fundamentally different replication strategies with contrasting outcomes for both virus and host, and these differences can be inferred from their genomic content.  Current research from induction experiments and metagenomic analyses suggest that temperate viral infections are favored in polar environments, especially during the winter, and may result in increased survival of both the virus and host. The study aims to 1) quantify the relative importance of lytic and temperate viral infections, 2) compare the genomic content of induced temperate viruses against free viruses and 3) use physical fractionation and targeted metagenomics to gain genomic context for signature temperate viral genes and key viral encoded genes. The work will be done in collaboration with the Palmer LTER.  Broader Impacts include presentations at international interdisciplinary meetings, peer reviewed scientific articles, public lectures and outreach through Biosphere 2, teach high school students through the University of Arizona partner programs BioME and BLAST, and participation in LTER outreach program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Southern Ocean surrounds Antarctica and is a very productive region of the worldÆs ocean, supporting a large food web that includes krill, penguins, seals, and whales.  This project focused on viruses in the Southern Ocean that infect bacteria, part of the base of this highly productive food web.  Viruses are natural components of the marine environment and exert considerable control over microorganisms and biogeochemical cycles by causing mortality of their microbial hosts, expressing metabolic genes during infection, and transferring genes between hosts.  To date, there is extremely limited information about viral ecology in the Southern Ocean and no information regarding their genetic content.              While the Southern Ocean is productive, that productivity is highly seasonal with low productivity for much of the year interspersed with increased productivity in summer.  Therefore, any organism that exists in the Southern Ocean will not only have to deal with near-freezing temperatures, but will also have to survive long periods of low productivity and be able to capitalize when productivity is high.  This research project investigates viruses in the Southern Ocean by directly testing two hypotheses:  (i) Viruses in the Southern Ocean are capable of alternating their replication strategies; remaining integrated into their bacterial hosts during times of low productivity (the lysogenic strategy), and switching to a different strategy when productivity is high where they lyse their hosts and are released to the water to infect new hosts (the lytic strategy); (ii) Viruses in the Southern Ocean will differ genetically from viruses in marine environments at lower latitudes.              To test these hypotheses, samples were collected twice weekly between November 2010 and January 2011 from the coastal surface ocean near Palmer Station, Antarctica, in conjunction with the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program.  Bacterial production changes dramatically during this period with a sharp increase in January, and was correlated with a switch between viruses using a predominantly lysogenic strategy in November and December to viruses using a predominantly lytic strategy in January (Figure 1).  Comparison of DNA sequences from the viral assemblages showed that viruses using the lysogenic strategy in November were predominantly the same viruses using the lytic strategy in January.  Thus, the majority of viruses in the Southern Ocean are temperate viruses that can use the lysogenic strategy to integrate into their hosts when bacterial production is low and switch to the lytic strategy when productivity increases in order to maximize viral production.              In addition, comparisons of DNA sequences from viral assemblages in the Southern Ocean with viral assemblages from a range of environments in lower latitude Pacific Ocean locations showed that viruses from the Southern Ocean only share approximately 50% of their genetic content with their lower latitude counterparts (Figure 2).  The unique genetic sequences in Southern Ocean viruses contained strong signals in genes encoding for chaperonins which may facilitate protein folding at lower temperatures, and transcriptional regulators which may be used to regulate their bacterial hostsÆ metabolism during the lysogenic phase of their replication, thus enhancing survival of their hosts when productivity is low.  This is the first examination of viral genetic content from the Southern Ocean and the results from this study suggest that viruses in the Southern Ocean are adapted to their environment in their replication strategies as well as their genetic content.
