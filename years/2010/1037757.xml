<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks integrate validated means of measuring development of creativity in engineering courses, then make these measures broadly available to the STEM community.  The PIs have previously developed metrics to measure creativity based on an action-assessment cycle in which individuals both create and consume creative actions and artifacts.  The metrics developed will be applied in a test-bed of five diverse courses in order to understand methods of effectively assessing creativity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project are to test the previously developed framework for creativity assessment and thereby increase the ability of instructors to foster creativity in engineering courses.  Tools for measuring creativity will be shared, via a web site, with the community of creativity and evaluation experts in order to foster broader application of the theoretical framework and instruments.  Within the PI's institution the project, if successful, will impact the creativity of students which may have long term impact on innovation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With increasing demands for creativity and innovation, it is imperative that engineering education prepare students that can meet and exceed these demands. In our interactions with technical and non-technical faculty, instructors have given us the impression they would try to teach creativity if only they knew how to assess it. Supported by a principle-centered view of creativity (Burgon, Elliott-Litchfield, &amp; Price, 2013), we developed instruments that eased their concerns and gave them practical means for gauging studentsÆ creative development. Creativity assessments are needed to capture creative processes as they happen in real time, for example in engineering classrooms. Therefore the specific objectives of this study were to increase creative capacity and understanding through (1) development of classroom-based creativity assessments (2) helping instructors and students to develop creativity assessment skills.  Assessments for Instructor Use:  Personal Creativity Assessment Archives (PCAA) &ndash; Logs in which instructors were asked to record 1) instructorsÆ and studentsÆ course activities, and 2) specific indicators of instructor and student creativity in the classroom.   Daily Instructor Assessment Log (DIAL) &ndash; 1) A spreadsheet in which instructors list the students who demonstrated particular classroom behaviors &ndash; questions, comments, collaboration, problem solving, and work, then provide specific examples of principle-based creative practice, and 2) a monthly summary with prompts to help instructors reflect on, analyze, and learn from the daily logs. Instructors were asked to record their own behaviors, reflect on how they may have prompted student response, and develop targeted action plans for instructor growth and improvement.     Assessments for Student Use:  1. Individual student projects  Personal Creativity Archive (PCA) &ndash; Daily log/diary documenting interesting information, questions and observations, ideas, project progress, and experiences and learning. Students create written and symbolic PCA syntheses at the end of the semester.  Curiosity and Problem Finding (CPF) &ndash; Students tune into their senses, question the information they get, and seek resources that can help them to answer questions.  Bio-Creativity 1 (Bio-C 1). Individuals identify a problem in the human world that they believe and suggest a problem solution inspired by the natural world.  What I Envision (WIE) &ndash; Students conduct research on what attempts have already been made to solve a problem they identified through CPF. The student then proposes a new and novel solution to the group.  You Teach Us (YTU) - Students learn something new, develop a lesson plan to teach what they have learned to others, and teach what they learned to a small group of classmates. The process is repeated a few times over the semester so students can enhance their practice.  2. Group student projects  What We Envision (WWE) &ndash; A teamÆs well-developed plan for solving a meaningful WIE problem over the course of the semester.  Bio-Creativity (Bio-C 2). Building on Bio-C 1, teams develop a well-researched proposal for a problem solution inspired by the natural world.  Fairy Tale Endings (FTE) &ndash; Teams rewrite a familiar fairytale to teach a principle of creativity, performing the fairy tale for the class.  Vision to Reality (V2R) &ndash;Teams create a meaningful product, and a report detailing their product development process.  The instructors felt the tools were helpful, particularly in capturing some of the creative capacities often overlooked in traditional engineering classroom assessments, fostering (1) creativity enhancement through truer-to-life projects, (2) opportunities to better recognize and meet student needs without relieving students of their responsibilities as creators, and (3) adequate measurement of student creativity. Perhaps the most interesting finding was unanticipated: Each of the instructors indepe...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
