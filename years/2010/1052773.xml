<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This innovative project explores in a novel fashion an emerging phenomenon of significant importance to academic research.  Public academic information resources on the social web are growing in size and number at a very rapid rate.  The goal of this project is to develop a quality assessment and an association discovery framework for online academic information, and ultimately to establish a novel framework for supporting researchers in accessing, organizing, utilizing, and exchanging all types of academic information. The proposed assessment framework will utilize the rich behaviors expressed in social reference data to design quality assessment measures that are tightly connected to the new data.  The framework will utilize publicly-available academic information on social reference sites, and examine association rules that connect two articles based on time periods, topics and social-network based measures.  The dynamic information environment of the web adds considerably to the challenges associated with this research.  However, if successful, the results will be of considerable value to many communities of domain researchers.</AbstractNarration>
