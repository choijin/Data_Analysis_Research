<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to support a planning visit to the Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics in Wuhan, China. Participants in the trip will include Professor Wenzhi Li, one graduate student, and one undergraduate.  The purpose of the trip is to develop a collaboration in research and education on synthesis and applications of carbon nanotubes and semiconducting nanowires in optoelectronic devices. The expertise of the Chinese collaborators in optoelectronics complements that of the PI in synthesis of novel nanomaterials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In promoting research collaboration among the participants, this planning visit will develop new materials and more effective devices for important applications, such as advanced sensors and solar cells. The participation of the students in this international program will broaden their personal and professional perspectives. The PI plans to involve undergraduate students from underrepresented populations, and this experience should stimulate them to continue in a scientific career.</AbstractNarration>
