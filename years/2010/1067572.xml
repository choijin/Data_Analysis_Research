<AbstractNarration>The use of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP) as a broad spectrum biocide in a wide range of consumer goods has grown exponentially in recent years, which will result in an increased release of Ag-NP into wastewater streams and ultimately the receiving bodies. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) play a critical role in the global nitrogen cycle and in the removal of nitrogen during wastewater treatment, thus preventing eutrophication of receiving waters. AOB are also widely considered to be the most sensitive fauna in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and are readily inhibited by many industrial contaminants including Ag-NP. This interdisciplinary proposal integrates the application of genomic and physiological assays with physical and chemical characterization techniques to elucidate the fate of Ag-NP in various water matrices, to identify the inhibition mechanism(s) of Ag-NP and to characterize the defense and recovery mechanisms employed by Nitrosomonas europaea, the model AOB, upon exposure to Ag-NP. &lt;br/&gt;The hypotheses that will be tested with the proposed experiments are: i) The fate of Ag-NP in natural and engineered systems, including dissolution, aggregation and partitioning to cells will depend on the capping agent used to stabilize the Ag-NP. ii) Ag-NP will inhibit N. europaea activity differently than silver ions (Ag+) and the inhibition is highly influenced by the capping agent, the size of the Ag-NP, the aqueous chemistry of the test media and the growth phase of the cells. iii) Transcriptional responses will differ between N. europaea cells exposed to Ag-NP and Ag+. iv) Sentinel genes can be identified and used to detect Ag+ and Ag-NP at sub-inhibitory concentrations in sequencing batch reactor and biofilm studies mimicking WWTP conditions. v) Biofilms will be more resistant to Ag+ and Ag-NP inhibition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This project will examine aggregation, partitioning to cells, and dissolution behavior of a suite of Ag-NPs with different capping agents in relevant water matrices. The inhibition of N. europaea by Ag+ and Ag-NP will then be evaluated in batch systems with tests focusing on the combinations of Ag-NP (with varying capping agents) and aqueous chemistries, including the presence of divalent They will then conduct microarray experiments to determine if Ag+ and Ag-NP cause a differential gene expression and will identify new sentinel genes for Ag+ and Ag-NP. Sequencing batch reactors (SBR) and biofilm experiments will be performed to determine the effects of both long- and short-term Ag+ and Ag-NP exposure on N. europaea. They will determine how well sentinel genes are correlated with Ag-NP concentrations. They will also investigate vertical profiles of nitrification within natural and artificial biofilms using microsensor techniques and will evaluate the spatial distribution of Ag-NP using a Laser Capture Microdissection Microscope. Spatial samples of the biofilm will be used to determine gene expression using qRT-PCR and TEM imaging coupled with elemental analysis will be used to determine the Ag-NP concentrations profiles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The work includes: Sentinel genes will be identified that can be used to detect the presence of Ag-NP and Ag+, at sub-inhibitory levels. These genes might be used in the development of biosensors for use in wastewater treatment and the environmental sensing of Ag-NP. Physiological consequences of inhibitory effects of Ag-NP as well as damage to cellular functions will also be determined for N. europaea, a model AOB. This research will be among the first to characterize how different capping agents affect the partitioning of Ag-NP and will add to the limited knowledge of the inhibition observed in biofilms. The researchers are members of the Safer Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Initiative (http://www.greennano.org/). Thus there is synergy with the activities being conducted as part of that Initiative, including interactions with companies manufacturing Ag-NP. &lt;br/&gt;A post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate student will be involved in the research. As in their past NSF-funded work, mentoring opportunities for the post-doc and graduate student include the independent supervision of undergraduate research, participation in grant writing, presenting at conferences, and publishing manuscripts as the lead and communicating author. They also plan to continue their involvement of under-represented undergraduate and high school students in this research through their continued participation in the Science and Engineering Summer Experience for Youths (http://cbee.oregonstate.edu/ sesey/), Saturday Academy (http://academy.engr.oregonstate.edu/) and the OSU Engineering Women and Minorities Tektronix Scholars program (http://engr.oregonstate.edu/wme/).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Our study focused on evaluating the toxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) to ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB).  Due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, AgNP {Trusts, 2011, The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies;Trust, 2012 #941}are increasingly being incorporated into consumer products.  However, the same antimicrobial properties that make AgNPs popular for consumer products has raised to concerns that their presence in wastewater could inhibit biological treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). It is expected that the primary release of AgNPs into the environment will occur through wastewater, since AgNP-containing products release AgNPs after washing (e.g. textiles and food containers) or through direct use (e.g. toothpastes and shampoos).  AOB are of particular concern since they play a critical role in the removal of ammonia from wastewater, which is required before the wastewater can be discharged to streams and rivers, and are widely considered to be the most sensitive microorganisms in WWTPs.  In this study, we used pure cultures of Nitrosomonas europaea to study the toxicity of AgNPs to AOB.  N. europaea is well characterized model AOB that is commonly found in WWTPs.  We evaluated how the water chemistry  affected AgNP toxicity to N. europaea, and whether the degree of toxicity differed when the bacteria were suspended in water (planktonic cells) or grown on surfaces as films (biofilms).  In previous studies, we observed that AgNP toxicity was primarily due to the dissolution of the AgNPs.  Dissolution is the release of silver ions (Ag+) from the AgNPs into the water.  Our rates of dissolution were much faster than had been observed by others.  In this current study, we found that it was the presence of ammonia in our test media that resulted in this increased rate of AgNP dissolution.  We observed that faster AgNP dissolution rates were associated with higher ammonia concentrations and higher toxicity to N. europaea.  We proposed a mechanism where ammonia likely enhanced the dissolution of the AgNP by forming silver-ammonia complexes, which was found to have equal toxicity to silver ions. Next, we studied how complex organic compounds found in wastewater altered the toxicity of both silver ions and AgNPs to N. europaea.  Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied as a model protein, while alginate was studied as a model extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), which are present in biofilms.  The presence of BSA offered protection to N. europaea from AgNP toxicity by adsorbing (tying up) the silver ions released by the AgNPs.  BSA further reduced AgNP toxicity by coating the AgNP surface thus slowing ammonia-dependent dissolution by blocking access of the AgNP surface to the ammonia molecules.  Alginate, however, did not strongly adsorb silver ions and did not protect N. europaea from silver ion toxicity.  Although, at high concentrations, alginate was able to reduce AgNP toxicity by coating the AgNP surface and slowing ammonia-dependent dissolution. Based on these results, silver ion and AgNP toxicity in high protein environments (e.g., wastewater) is expected to be muted, while the EPS layers of wastewater biofilms may provide additional protection from AgNPs, but not silver ions. Finally, the effects of AgNP on biofilms of N. europaea we examined and compared to those of suspended cells.  Silver ions were found to inhibit both biofilms and suspended cells to a greater degree than AgNPs. Cell death was responsible, for some, but not all of the observed inhibition. The release of cells from the biofilm (i.e. sloughing) during exposure to silver ions or AgNP also was responsible for the decrease in activity.  While intact biofilms were more resistant to silver ions than suspended cells, they were no more resistant to silver than suspended cells when the biofilms were broken apart.  The increased resistance of N. europaea biofilms compared to suspended cells is attributable to protection off...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
