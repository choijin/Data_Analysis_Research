<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Bristol Community CollegeÆs (BCC) Sustainability And Green Energy Across the Curriculum (SAGE) project was designed to build regional capacity to train the next generation of engineering technicians to apply principles of sustainability, including renewable, efficient and clean energy production, in a range of technical careers.   The overarching goal of the SAGE project is to build the capacity of BCC and other educational partners in the region to train and prepare young technicians and engineers for careers in the growing green energy sectors.  The project focused on 4 key objectives:  1) Expand the pipeline and success of technical students and improve their readiness to solve 21st century problems by restructuring BCCÆs Engineering Technology program curriculum to teach the principles of sustainability and the technologies,  2) Build capacity of BCC faculty and other regional high school and college instructors to teach principles and technology of clean, renewable and efficient energy and other sustainable practices,  3) Expand the pipeline of college-ready students pursuing technical academic and career paths with emphasis on students traditionally underrepresented, and  4) Provide support and guidance for BCC students in SAGE programs to support retention and completion of certificate and degrees that lead to careers in the green energy field.   The following outcomes were obtained during the life of the grant:     1. Restructuring the BCC Engineering Technology Program.     Revised seven engineering program options to include sustainability and green technology courses, revised 6 existing courses (two major revisions, and 4 minor revisions), and created four new courses for the new Green Technology program options. Two certificate programs were created (Wind Power and Solar Energy) and one certificate program was revised (Green Building). To support the new Sustainable Technology Associate Degrees and Certificates the project created two new Green Energy Laboratories &ndash; Wind and Solar.   2. Building capacity of BCC faculty and other regional educators to teach principles of Sustainability and Green technologies.     Offered three annual SAGE Summer Institutes on Green Building, Wind Power, and Solar Energy.  Offered five professional development workshops and one webinar for secondary and post-secondary educators and staff.  Expanded the current engineering lending lab to include green technology resources. The Lending Lab provides access to 90 pieces of environmental and green technology equipment free of charge to educators in the region.   Created SAGE Website, which includes Lending Lab resource and professional development opportunities at www.BCCSAGE.com  Provided teacher externships for high school teachers to develop engineering and sustainable unit plans utilizing SAGE Lending Lab resources. Provided green technology training to 65 educators in the region.      3.  Expand the pipeline of college?ready students pursuing technical academic and career paths.     Developed 5 interactive presentations for use with high school populations. The presentations include: 1) Engineering and Green Technology overview 2) Solar (utilizes Hydrogen Fuel Cell Cars), 3) Wind (utilizes Kid Wind AL Turbine), 4) Women in Engineering (WIE), 5) YouÆre graduating...now what? Provided 59 interactive presentations to over 1950 high school students throughout the life of the grant. Through our Career Vocational Technical Education program the engineering department developed 9 course articulation agreements (29 college credits) with 17 high schools for a total of 140 engineering articulations.    4. Provide support and guidance for BCC students in SAGE programs to support retention and completion of certificate and degrees that lead to careers in the green energy field.    Created the BCC Engineering Ambassador program. Ambassadors participate in high school and community outreach and recruitment activities to create greater aware...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
