<AbstractNarration>Within-population color polymorphisms provide biologists with eye-catching examples in which to study how variation is maintained. Little is known about polymorphisms caused by pterins, a genetically determined class of pigments.  This study examines the pterin-based red/yellow fin polymorphism found in male bluefin killifish Lucania goodei. The L. goodei system is unique in that there are no behavioral types associated with the polymorphism or rare-male advantage via sexual selection.  However, in many populations, males with yellow fins are less heavily parasitized than those with red fins. By designing genetic markers for the polymorphism, this study integrates population genetics, laboratory experiments, and gene expression analyses to determine how the red/yellow polymorphism is maintained and to examine more closely the link between immunity and pterin production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research not only addresses the outstanding question in evolutionary biology of how variation is maintained, but it utilizes a novel pterin-based pigment system to do so. The newly developed RAD tag method is used to develop markers for a non-model species, and the project fosters a cross-university collaboration between evolutionary biologists at the University of Illinois and geneticists at the University of Oregon. The work will enhance undergraduate training by including undergraduate assistants and developing a laboratory activity for an Ichthyology course that is based on this pigment identification research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, is a small freshwater fish found throughout the southeast United States.  This common fish has an uncommon trait that sets it apart from most other species: males from the same population come in multiple anal fin color morphs (red, yellow, and blue).  In other polymorphic species, distinct morphs are associated with distinct behaviors, and rare morphs have an advantage that keeps them from being eliminated.  This doesnÆt appear to be the case in the bluefin killifish, however, and so the force maintaining the color polymorphism is a mystery.  This grant has funded work so solve this evolutionary puzzle.     The work done for this grant has concluded that the pigments responsible for the red and yellow coloration are red and yellow pterins. Blue is caused by the molecular structure of the fins.  Unlike other pigments (e.g. melanin and carotenoid) pterin pigmentation has been studied in very few organisms, so the work here is really setting the dialog for future studies on this type of pigmentation.  We have found that in fish collected directly from the wild, red-morph males are more likely to be infected by parasites, which is interesting because females seam to have a small preference for mating with red males.  In one study in preparation right now, we have found that males with more anal fin pigmentation for their size are parasitized less.  Because males also have carotenoid and melanin pigmentation, this study contrasts information about pterin pigmentation with these other pigments (see figure 1).  We have found that melanin pigment is a "badge of status" that symbolizes dominance, and carotenoid pigmentation is a marker of condition. In another study in review right now, we found that time of day affects the fish perception of color.  Opsins, key proteins in the eyeÆs rods and cones, vary over the course of the day.  The color of light also varies, with light becoming more "blue" at dawn and dusk.  We show that the fish prefer the color red at dawn and dusk, when there is less red light, and they prefer blue at noon, when there is less blue light.  This suggests that female perception of color might also help to maintain the color polymorphism if they prefer to mate with different color morphs at different times of day.  In another study being analyzed right now, we are matching paternity success with anal fin color morph.  It may be that certain females (who are colorless but still carry the genes for anal fin coloration) prefer specific males who carry different genes from them.  This would also help to maintain the color polymorphism.   Eventually, we will have a marker that identifies color, and we will be able to determine if mate choice based on color is one mechanism that is operating to maintain color diversity.     In addition to increasing knowledge in an understudied pigment, this work has helped train future scientists.  It was the basis of an upper-level undergraduate laboratory project taught in ichthyology, in which students identified pigment in local fishes.  Three undergraduates worked directly on this project, getting firsthand knowledge of molecular techniques.  One undergraduate student gained authorship on an article now in review.   Because animal coloration is so conspicuous, projects like these really help students become interested in biology.
