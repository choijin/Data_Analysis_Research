<AbstractNarration>Carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere exceeds that in the atmosphere by a factor of four, and represents a dynamic balance between carbon inputs and losses.  This balance is being altered by climate change and land-use, with important impacts on terrestrial carbon storage and, hence, atmospheric CO2 levels.  However, the response of terrestrial carbon cycling to warming and interactions with land-use remain poorly quantified. This study will examine how rising temperature and land-use interact to regulate carbon input, allocation, and loss in a model study system, thereby enhancing capacity to predict how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to the interactive effects of warming and land-use. To do this, we will measure aboveground and belowground carbon storage and exchange across a 6°C temperature gradient within the Hawaii Experimental Tropical Forest.  At each of four temperature regimes, paired and replicated plots will be established in degraded pasture, secondary native forest, and intact native forest to examine how mean annual temperature and land-use interact to affect carbon input, allocation and loss in forest ecosystems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to examining how rising temperature and land-use interact to impact terrestrial carbon balance, this study will also: (i) build a model global change research platform that can be used by other scientists; (ii) provide critical data on terrestrial carbon storage to the global change community, including scientists, policy makers, and land managers; (iii) enhance graduate and postdoctoral training and undergraduate science education at a Native Hawaiian serving institution; and (iv) foster collaboration between the University of Hawaii and the USDA Forest Service on the newly established Hawaii Experimental Tropical Forest.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit   Results from this study are providing an increasingly detailed picture of how carbon cycling in tropical wet forest will respond to rising mean annual temperature. First, we found that total carbon input (GPP) increases with mean annual temperature, which supports several prior global, cross-site analyses.

However, contrary to prior predictions we found that soil carbon storage did not vary with mean annual temperature, indicating that rising temperature will not result in increased soil carbon decomposition and a positive feedback to climate change, at least in tropical wet forests.
