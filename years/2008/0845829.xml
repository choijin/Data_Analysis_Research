<AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) to Professor James P. Donahue of Tulane University addresses the synthetic and thermodynamic challenges of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that threatens our social, economic and environmental security because of its potential to induce climate change through global warming. The ability to transform even a small percentage of anthropogenic CO2 to chemical fuels that can be transported and stored would be beneficial. A key transformation in CO2 reduction, and the most energy intensive step, is the transformation to carbon monoxide (CO). The Donahue laboratory utilizes unique, bioinorganic-inspired approaches to catalytic CO2-to-CO reduction. The broader impacts of this work include the possible development of new insights into how nature has modified (and presumably lowered) the kinetic barrier that prevents CO2 from being easily utilized as a chemical feedstock for fuels, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. Undergraduate students from local small colleges that do not have access to research facilities are engaged in Professor Donahue's laboratories. Additionally, the chemistry demonstration series has been re-instated in New Orleans grade schools. The undergraduates involved in this project fulfill the requirements of a new public service degree requirement at Tulane Univeristy while sparking curiosity in chemistry at the grade school and middle school levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Eighteen publications have resulted in whole or part, from support from the PIÆs CAREER Award, CHE-0845929. Several more manuscripts are in preparation. Four graduate students earned Ph.D.s during this funded period. This award funded research aimed at CO2-to-CO reduction using low valent tungsten compounds, synthesis of an analogue of the catalytic site of the Mo-Cu CO dehydrogenase metalloenzyme, and synthesis of complex metallodithiolene compounds.  A noteworthy result was the development of a W-mediated closed cycle of reactivity for CO2-to-CO reduction. This report was useful in calling attention to the possibilities for early/middle transition metal systems to effect CO2 reduction and be turned over for re-use. A surprising find was that the O atom excised from CO2 by W could in turn be exchanged for two Cl- ligands using HCl(g). Computational assessment of the energetics of each step indicated that thermal loss of CO from [WIVO(CO)Cl2(PMePh2)2] was endothermic by ~56 kJ/mol but that the 2HCl + O2- &rarr; 2Cl- + H2O exchange was near thermoneutral.  On the bioinorganic topic of a small-molecule analogue of the Mo-S-Cu heterodimetal active site of CODH, which relates to CO2 reduction inasmuch as the enzymes functions to equilibrate CO2 and CO according to CO2 + 2H+ + 2e- &harr; CO + H2O, the PI reported new Cu(I) coordination chemistry with the bulky triptycyl thiolate ligand (Fig. 1). One of the Cu compounds reported, [Bu4N][Cu6(&mu;6-Br)(&mu;2-STrip)6] was of a structural type not observed previously in Cu thiolate chemistry. A key compound targeted for synthesis was [Et4N][CuI(STrip)(SSiPh3)], desired as a synthon for silane-mediated coupling of separate Mo and Cu fragments to form a Mo-S-Cu enzyme active site analogue.  Fundamental studies were undertaken of metallodithiolene systems that manifest ligand redox non-innocence in distinctive and subtle ways that may have important implications for the design of new materials or catalysts. Several examples of this dithiolene ligand noninnocence were reported (Scheme 2): 1) Association of two PR&acute;3 ligands (normally not a redox process!) to square planar [PtII(S2C2R2)2] to afford [PtIV(S2C2R2)2(PR&acute;3)2]. The PtII ion is oxidized by dithiolene radical monoanionic ligands such the PtIV oxidation state can be created that is typical of 6-coordinate octahedral Pt (Scheme 2, top). 2) Substitution of CO ligands in [W(S2C2Me2)2(CO)2] by [Et4N][CN] to afford isoelectronic [W(S2C2Me2)2(CN)2]2- is attended by dramatic change in the dithiolene ligands. The ligands are reduced from radical monoanions, mdt&bull;1-, to fully reduced ene-1,2-dithiolates, mdt2-, even though the net process is simple ligand substitution, not an overall redox reaction. This major internal electronic change is associated with the better &pi;-acid ability of CO vs. CN- (Scheme 2, middle). 3) Coordination geometry change from trigonal prismatic to octahedral by [W(CO)4(S2C2Me2)] as function of reversible one-electron reduction. The net one-electron reduction is a two-electron reduction of tungsten attended by an offsetting one-electron oxidation of the dithiolene dianion, mdt2-, to dithiolene radical monoanion, mdt&bull;1-. Trigonal prismatic [W(CO)4(S2C2Me2)] and the related octahedral compound [W(CO)4(Me2pipdt)] (Me4pipdt = 1,4-dimethylpiperazine-2,3-dithione), also made by the PI, are featured on the cover the newest edition of CrabtreeÆs organometallic textbook, which underscores their fundamental interest. Ligand redox non-innocent behavior of the sort exemplified Scheme 2 could find application in the design of materials that experience significant property changes (e.g., large spin crossovers) as function of redox chemistry.  The PIÆs CAREER award was used to engage undergraduate students in summer research, primarily students from groups underrepresented in the physical sciences. In the summers of 2009 and 2010, a summer student from LSU participated in guided research in the PIÆs lab and co...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
