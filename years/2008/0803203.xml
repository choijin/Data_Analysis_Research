<AbstractNarration>The thermodynamic properties of aqueous systems that constitute aerosol particles in the mid and upper troposphere will be investigated.  Because, depending on their phase, these aerosols may be involved in cirrus cloud formation and contribute to earth's radiation balance, their phase diagrams and relative humidity/solute concentration relationships will be studied.  Temperature-dependent deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) and concentration/activity relationships will be measured using humidity-controlled thermogravimetric analysis (HTGA) for several aqueous dicarboxylic acids in the range 303 - 253 K: malonic (C3H4O4), oxalic (C2H2O4), succinic (C4H6O4), maleic (C4H4O4), malic (C4H6O5), and glutaric (C5H8O4).  Low temperature liquid/solid equilibrium phase diagrams will also be investigated.  Enthalpies of transition, the temperature-dependent DRH, and concentration/activity relationships will be measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy of thin films, and HTGA for ternary systems of dicarboxylic acids, ammonium sulfate, and water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be used to validate and constrain atmospheric aerosol models.  Undergraduate students will be extensively involved in laboratory experimental work, data analysis, and communication of results.  A new research grade humidity-controlled thermogravimetric analyzer (HTGA) will be purchased, which will enhance the research and teaching infrastructure at the grantee institution.  Students will gain extensive experience with FTIR and DSC instruments as well as the HTGA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             We have studied how air pollution molecules impact when aerosols may form in the atmosphere.  These aerosols are likely a source of cirrus cloud formation and/or contribute to the earthÆs radiation balance as a function of whether they are in a frozen, solid form, liquid form or some kind of mixture.  Many different types of molecules are released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity.  As one example, fast-food chains have large frying operations where exhaust fans blow the frying products out to the atmosphere.  After some time, these molecules break down in the atmosphere from long chain molecules to short chain molecules that have had oxygen atoms added to them in the process.  Many of the most abundant products found in the atmosphere are dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, malic, and glutaric acids.  Additionally, ammonium is found everywhere in earthÆs atmosphere as it is released globally by human and animal activities such as livestock, applying fertilizers, etc.  Also, sulfate has many natural (volcaoes) and man-made sources (burning coal, etc.)  These two chemicals easily combine in the atmosphere to form the compound ammonium sulfate, which is very soluble in water aerosols and drops.              Thus, we combined these two sets of chemicals (dicarboxylic acids and ammonium sulfate) in water-based solutions and studied their physical properties in the lab.  In particular we studied the conditions under which ice may form in the droplets, the conditions under which non-water molecules may crystallize in the solutions (when the solution is saturated), and the conditions (relative humidity) under which a dry particle will take up water at different temperatures typically found in the atmosphere.  The results of our studies were written in seven articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals over the term of the grant.              Our results also have broader impacts on understanding our atmosphere.  The results of this research serve as direct input to atmospheric aerosol models, both in terms of parameterizing and constraining models, as well as validation of the predictions of existing models.  This research has extensively involved undergraduate students in laboratory experimental work, data analysis, and communication of results.  Eight undergraduate students participated in the work over the course of seven years, and seven were co-authors on the publications of our research.  This gramt also funded the acquisition of a new, research grade instrument, humidity controlled thermogravimetric analyzer (HTGA), which allowed us to perform the relative humidity experiments.  This instrument significantly enhanced the research and teaching infrastructure at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.  This instrument embodies a technique that is not currently used in atmospheric chemistry laboratory studies, and so represents an advancement of the field in this area.  Thus students have gained extensive experience with research-grade scientific instruments, which has significantly helped each of them in their respective scientific careers.
