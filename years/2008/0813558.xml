<AbstractNarration>The Louisiana State Museum and Tulane University/Xavier University Center for Bioenvironmental Research and the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography, along with several other research collaborators, designers, evaluators, and the Times-Picayune newspaper are partnering to develop a multi-pronged approach on educating the general public, school children, teachers and public officials on the STEM-related aspects of Hurricane Katrina and its implications for the future of New Orleans and other parts of the country.  The major products will be an 8,500 square-foot semi-permanent exhibit, smaller exhibits for Louisiana regional libraries, a comprehensive Web site on hurricanes, a set of studies on informal learning, a case study for public officials about the relevance of science research to policy and planning, teacher workshops, and a workshop for interested exhibit designers from around the country.&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the field of informal science education by exploring how museums, universities, and their communities can work together to provide meaningful learning experiences on STEM topics that are critical to solving important community and national issues.</AbstractNarration>

The exhibition, <em>Living with Hurricanes: Katrina and Beyond,</em> is accompanied by a substantive interactive web site, important visitor research, and education and outreach programs.

Public programming complements the exhibition&rsquo;s themes. The<em> Coastal Conversations</em> series aims to draw new visitors to the exhibit and foster community discussion about hurricane preparedness and protection, coastal restoration, and related issues.
