<AbstractNarration>The Education Development Center is carrying out a research and development project related to a set of professional development materials previously developed with support from the National Science Foundation.  The materials, Math for All (MFA), are for the professional development of teachers who teach elementary school students with disabilities.  The current project has three distinct components.  1) Conduct a qualitative study on the way the facilitators use the professional development materials.  2) Based on that study develop resources for teacher leaders and other facilitators of professional development. These resources include a Facilitator Case Book, a model for facilitator institutes, and a model for continued on-line support for facilitators. 3) Conduct an experimental study, using a randomized controlled trial model, to determine the effectiveness of these resources.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>School districts across the country face a pressing need to increase access to significant mathematics content for students with disabilities. To help address this issue, two NSF-funded projects, <em>Math for All</em> (MFA, elementary grades) and <em>Addressing Accessibility in Mathematics</em> (AAM, middle grades), created intensive professional development (PD) programs to help both general and special educators improve mathematics instruction for students with disabilities. Prior research indicated that these programs, when implemented by the developers themselves, have a positive impact on teachers&rsquo; content knowledge and instructional practices. However, since widespread use of these programs relies on their implementation by facilitators other than the developers, it was important to understand how staff developers enact the programs in their districts.

Many of the participating staff developers continue to use the AAM and MFA programs with new groups of teachers, thereby continuing to increase the number of teachers and students affected through this project.     By studying two distinct PD programs, we were able to generalize our findings more readily beyond the individual program l...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
