<AbstractNarration>This grant is in support of a Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) workshop. While food waste has been studied in the scientific literature, primarily from the technical perspective, much of the existing research is fragmented across single disciplines and disconnected case studies. Modeling, managing, assessing, and replicating sustainable urban food waste solutions will require novel research approaches, organized under the principle of convergence, which deeply integrates knowledge and methods from different disciplines, and carried out through meaningful collaborations between scientific researchers and stakeholders embedded in the food supply chain. This SUS workshop is targeted to catalyze these collaborations, provide a platform of exchanging knowledge across fields, and establish a sustainable urban systems research agenda organized around the specific and compelling problem of minimizing and managing food waste for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit. A key aspect is the planned approach to capturing geographic heterogeneity in urban food waste systems and solutions, by structuring the workshop scope to consider both aggregate impact of multiple urban areas in a single state and comparative analysis of cities across the U.S. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient, resilient, and robust food supply chains are a critical part of sustainable urban systems. Knowledge created by convergent research networks can inform design of resource-efficient technologies, policies, and social interventions to minimize food waste and attendant energy, water, and resource use in cities and the peri-urban and rural regions on which they rely. Research catalyzed by this workshop is expected to generate new models of multi-scale transboundary interactions and innovative solutions for urban food waste challenges. These findings have potential for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit, and will be broadly disseminated to both scientific and stakeholder audiences. The workshop is anticipated to lead to greater understanding of how SUS science can be communicated effectively to help individuals, communities, and businesses take action to reduce their contribution to food waste. The workshop will also provide attendees with new understanding and approaches to engage traditionally underrepresented groups, particularly deaf/hard of hearing learners and scientists, in research leading to discovery and innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A sustainable food supply chain is critical to the well-being and economic vitality of urban areas, yet the fundamental question persists: how do you sustain a growing urban population given a shrinking pool of natural resources? This challenge is made even more complex by the vast resource consumption and resulting waste generated across the food supply chain. Transforming a wasteful, inefficient urban food system into a sustainable, regenerative urban resource will require researchers and stakeholders to co-develop knowledge on the fundamental drivers causing food to be lost along the food supply chain and the novel solutions that can reduce losses and recover energy and value from inevitable wastes. Urban food waste solutions require novel research approaches, organized under the principle of convergence, which integrates knowledge and methods across disciplines, and carried out via collaborations between scientific researchers and stakeholders in the food supply chain.</p> <p><br />This Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) workshop tackled these questions by creating new collaborations, providing a platform for exchanging ideas across fields, and formulating a sustainable urban systems research agenda. The workshop was organized around the specific problem of sustaining the urban food system by minimizing and managing food waste for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit. The workshop engaged 47 participants from across the United States from academic disciplines including science, engineering, economics, business, policy, social science, education, public health, computer science, architecture, and design. Participants also represented non-profit, consulting, business, government, non-governmental organizations, entrepreneurial, and education sectors. All parts of the&nbsp; food supply chain were represented, from farming and food production and retail to food rescue, waste collection, hauling, and recycling.The workshop findings identified high-priority research needs, organized here into three themes:&nbsp;</p> <p>1) Innovative, interdisciplinary solutions that have the potential to transform the urban food system, including:</p> <ul> <li>Understanding the potential for urban agriculture innovations to reduce waste by localizing food production;</li> <li>Determining how to educate and engage stakeholders to prevent and minimize food losses;</li> <li>Creating and evaluating novel food packaging to prevent food spoilage and eliminate contamination in downstream food waste systems;</li> <li>Establishing risks, policy, and incentives for food rescue and donation that prioritize health and food access;</li> <li>Creating an ecosystem of urban-scale waste collection, transportation, and treatment technologies that retain resources and value within the urban region; and</li> <li>Optimizing food waste valorization pathways according to available food waste streams and markets for bio-energy and bio-products generated.</li> </ul> <p>2) Overcoming barriers and activating enablers that will facilitate implementation of new solutions, including:</p> <ul> <li>Creating new business models and economic incentives for waste minimization and recovery;</li> <li>Leveraging proactive food and food waste policies informed by science and stakeholders;</li> <li>Incorporating dynamic trends in technology and consumer behavior, such as 'smart' technologies for enhanced data and information;</li> <li>Collecting data across the food supply chain that will enable effective decision making; and</li> <li>Forming collaborations between researchers and stakeholders aimed at co-creating knowledge that integrates experience and applications.</li> </ul> <p>3) Evaluating cross-cutting research questions underlying urban food system transformation, including:</p> <ul> <li>How can entrenched urban systems be changed through large-scale sustainable transformations?&nbsp;</li> <li>How can successful solutions be scaled up and replicated across cities of different sizes and in different regions?</li> <li>How can we evaluate if food system solutions lead to measurable social, economic, and environmental gains?</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A safe, sustainable, secure food supply is a necessary facet of a sustainable urban system. Research described herein - and the new convergent collaborations assembled to carry out this research - offer the potential for transforming the urban food system by minimizing food losses, improving public health and sustainability outcomes, and reducing and managing unavoidable food waste. Our workshop demonstrated how new collaborations across academic disciplines and knowledge co-created with food system stakeholders can lead to a compelling, creative, and novel research vision. Bringing this vision to bear on the challenge of sustainable urban food systems will require fundamental research advances on all facets of food loss and waste (Babbitt 2019): from experimental analysis and 'proof of concept' for novel technologies to models of how these solutions overcome cultural, political, and technical barriers for widespread deployment; from economic and environmental benefit-cost analyses for a single urban case study to a generalizable decision model drawing from U.S.-wide urban cross-comparisons; and from lessons learned in historical analyses of sustainable interventions to future-oriented scenarios of complex, interacting urban agents and infrastructure that will give rise to a sustainable urban food system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/21/2020<br>      Modified by: Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660345088_BK2Q5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660345088_BK2Q5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Workshop Wordcloud"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660345088_BK2Q5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Workshop Wordcloud"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Thematic analysis of workshop discussions and findings, highlighting most common terms used.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jessica Oehman</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Workshop Wordcloud</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660625793_Workshop_galleria--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660625793_Workshop_galleria--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Workshop Session"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660625793_Workshop_galleria--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Workshop Session"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Workshop participants discuss novel hydroponics technology as a pathway to increased food access and decreased food waste.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Melissa Hall</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</div> <div class="imageTitle">Workshop Session</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
