<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses biofouling (unwanted attachment of aquatic organisms, e.g. barnacles) of ships . Current antifouling methods are both harmful to the environment and costly. Toxic paints may pollute our seas and waterways. Maintenance to mitigate biofouling is labor-intensive, expensive, and somewhat hazardous. Increases in fuel costs due to frictional drag during a vessel’s operation can approach 40%.  This project will develop an innovative electronic approach to biofouling prevention by developing submersible ultrasonic transducer arrays optimized for low voltage operation in a marina.   The near-term commercial opportunity is with both marina owners and larger marina nationwide operators, with long-term opportunities in commercial and naval military transport, a total addressable market of approximately $10 billion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the challenges for commercial deployment of transducer arrays to prevent biofouling of ships docked in marinas, and will enhance the scientific understanding of acoustic wave generation in water using piezoelectric transducers and the opportunity to use shock waves to prevent the attachment of bio-species to hulls of ships.  The program has four scientific objectives:   1) Define the maximum fouling-free area and distance possible with a single, ultrasonic transducer mounted 30 to 50 cm underwater, on target surfaces 1 to 15 meters distant.  2) Achieve low-voltage operation required for commercial deployment, using new transducers with low impedance in submersible housings.  3) Develop an ultrasound sensor in a waterproof housing to create a coherent array for full coverage.  4) Develop a prototype electronically steerable array demonstrating a significantly larger biofouling-free area than a fixed transducer element, to enable use on larger ships, such as commercial and military transport.  A beam-steering solution will reduce the required number of transducers for increased functionality.  The program will innovate in areas such as acoustic beam steering, electronic design of piezoelectric transducers, and electro/mechanical design for submersible housings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ WaveArray (WA) has embarked on an ambitious goal of using a novel electronic method for preventing biofouling of boats without the use of the currently employed bottom paint that are polluting the world’s waterways. It is widely recognized that biofouling of boats, especially large Naval and Commercial Vessels, increases fuel consumption by as much as 40%, contributing to unnecessary fuel cost and carbon emission pollution. However, the use of antifouling paints, that leach toxic chemicals into our waterways both offset and are in direct contradiction to helping the environment.  Our Phase I results are a powerful step forward both in our technical accomplishments as well as commercial findings.  Our goal of keeping boats in marinas biofouling free was enthusiastically endorsed by many of the potential customer interviews.  In fact our commercial entry has been accelerated by the need for short distance biofouling prevention on docks and ladders that are a high "pain point" for marina operators.  The results of our work are summarized in four objectives.  Objective I - WA experimentally determined the threshold sound pressure level (SPL) to keep a surface biofouling free.  Additionally, this objective examined the fouling-free area possible with a single submerged ultrasonic transducer which is referred to as the Area of Influence (AOI). The photo attached shows an example of a test where an area was kept biofouling free by projecting sound waves on the surface.    Objective II - WA Phase I R&amp;D focused on achieving biofouling prevention at low voltage (30-60Vrms).  High voltage is an anathema to marina and boat owners due to human electro-shock and boat corrosion concerns. R&amp;D focused on experimenting with the piezoelectric elements of transducers (the sound projectors used in the R&amp;D) and novel submersible housing designs and materials. Much effort was needed to not only achieve the electrical and mechanical objectives but finding the right materials and coatings that can withstand the harsh environment of warm, salty water for a practical deployment. WA has met our goals of achieving low voltage operation.  Novel transducer designs have been simulated that could provide 6x the distance of current designs.  Objective III - In order to measure sound reflected off the target as far from the transmitting source as possible and in every direction, a proprietary methodology was demonstrated to measure the direction and amplitude of the delivered transducer energy. This innovation will lead to a product that can measure the SPL on the target. The sensor information can then be used to adjust the transmitted energy to where it is needed.  Objective IV - Probably the most significant accomplishments in our Phase I efforts was a proprietary methodology to project sound pressure 4x greater than current methods.  This is important to commercial success, i.e., that a target can be placed far from the array (10x -15x) and still get antifouling protection. Additionally, WAs proprietary methods also enlarge the biofouling-free area (~3x) that can be achieved.  In practice this means that when the technology is perfected, any size boat in any configuration in a marina or even placed inside the hull of a boat will be able to achieve the minimum SPL needed for complete biofouling prevention.  Summary  The results of the Phase I program has given us great confidence that WaveArray can achieve its technical and commercial goals of preventing biofouling while eliminating the need for bottom paints that pollute our waterways.
