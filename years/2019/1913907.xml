<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project is dedicated to creating a whole-classroom virtual reality (VR) experience for middle school students to be exposed to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) topics interactively as a supplement to the existing curriculum. While immersed in their very own 3D virtual treehouse lab, students will be able to join other student labs and collaboratively explore a variety of Next Generation Science Concepts, such as the Periodic Elements and their properties. This is facilitated by a teacher-oriented desktop and VR interface that makes it possible to manage an entire class of students simultaneously participating in VR activities. By leveraging the use of affordable standalone VR headsets, and elevating VR beyond its current one-student-at-a-time use case, the project will be pioneering the highly anticipated market of virtual field trips for use in authentic learning environments. This is aligned with the National Science Foundation's Education Research Area, which seeks to achieve excellence in U.S. STEM education at all levels in all settings, because the value of classroom-VR rests on its unique ability to provide more effective learning settings to more students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will develop an immersive multiplayer virtual reality (VR) learning game for authentic classroom usage. The project will apply the advantages of a modular game design built around self-directed goals to test a classroom-management system built to allow an entire class of students to collaborate in or outside virtual reality. While immersed in individual 3D virtual environments, students will be able to join virtual spaces belonging to other students, in order to accomplish shared goals set by the teacher at a class level. The project also seeks to further the general field of learning games, by applying the Universal Design for Learning framework to its local goal of enhancing middle-schoolers' relationships to and content knowledge of STEM topics. This permits the project to be a test-bed for educational VR content design and interaction schemes. In Phase I research, the project team will examine whether students are able to understand how to play the game with minimal or no external help, whether teachers can integrate the product with their classroom environment, how large of a group a teacher can manage while keeping students on-task, whether student relationships to the subject matter change, and whether teachers and students see the fully realized product as a potentially effective learning tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

At the core of Phase I were software innovations which introduced a new model for enabling classroom-VR experiences in arbitrary environment conditions. Those innovations resulted in a pioneering demonstration of an authentic, inclusive use-case for consumer 6-degrees-of-freedom VR technology in a classroom setting.</p> <p><strong>Product Overview</strong></p> <p><em>Tablecraft</em>&nbsp;is a multiplayer VR learning platform which combines Universal Design for Learning principles with video game design to significantly enhance students' relationships to, and conceptual understanding of STEM subject matter.</p> <p><strong>Existing Curriculum</strong></p> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Tablecraft</em>, the Periodic Elements were the first trial subject tackled in a broader mission to introduce abstract concepts in more tangible and personal ways. In this initial iteration of the product, the Elements were rendered as simple cubes in physical space - cubes that students can play with, but also, which they can combine to craft interesting objects, furniture or tools they've held in their own lives. As students create objects out of the Element Cubes (because they want to feed their virtual pets, meet the requests of their visiting alien guests, or for other creative reasons of their own, such as decorating the lab), the whole experience feels playful and explorative; it feels like something they're good at, because they put those cubes together and they figured it out. They discovered an element, and they've had to deal with and understand its properties. In doing so, the seemingly abstract grid of numerals and weird names that make up the Periodic Table slowly becomes a familiar collection of building blocks which make up the universe of real, bona-fide stuff. With that formative experience, when players sit in class, they see the Periodic Table on the classroom wall as just a little more theirs.</p> <p><strong>Present Functionality for Broad Participation</strong></p> <p><em>Tablecraft</em>&nbsp;can support arbitrary numbers of users. With&nbsp;<em>Tablecraft</em>'s free iOS and Android app, non-VR users can search for and join the VR labs of those connected to the same wireless network. In these shared labs, players are able to perform tasks for each other, share creations and discoveries, exchange access to virtual tools, and take advantage of the social space to explore gameplay ideas with one another as they experiment together, or individually at their own pace. Using the same app, teachers, who cannot be in VR for reasons of supervision, are also able to easily jump from lab to lab, see each lab's statistics, communicate with the students in VR and even help students with their virtual activities.</p> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-11aed230-7fff-1774-95c2-4291c2c530c6">Both mobile and VR users have their own avatars in the virtual space, which creates a true feeling of mutual presence. This allows players to wave and speak directly to their peers as they see each other in the virtual world, which is a memorable social interaction and greatly mitigates VR isolation.

Other accessibility features include support for varying player heights, as well as some visual and hearing aid options. For instance, the interactive Periodic Table can be moved closer to the user; the virtual desk height can be adjusted; text tooltips can identify any objects in the virtual lab, and Element names can be read out-loud by a friendly robot companion.</p> <p><strong>Present Functionality for User Progress Assessment</strong></p> <p><em>Tablecraft</em>'s mobile app provides aggregated data on individual VR user behavior in real time.
