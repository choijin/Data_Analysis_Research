<AbstractNarration>The 2019 Tropical Cyclone Operations and Research Forum (TCORF), the 73rd Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference (IHC) will be held on March 12 -13, 2019 at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science - University of Miami in Miami, FL. Topics will include research addressing operational imperatives, challenges in observing and forecasting during the 2018 hurricane season, Joint Hurricane Testbed activities, and the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program. A meeting of the Working Group for Hurricane and Winter Storms Operation and Research, which supports the annual update of the National Hurricane Operations Plan, will be a part of the forum. The forum is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, NOAA National Weather Service, and the Office of Naval Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;At the TCORF/73rd IHC, representatives from Federal agencies and the academic research community will have the opportunity to discuss the latest research into tropical cyclone observing, forecasting, and warning such as:&lt;br/&gt;1. 2018 hurricane/typhoon season challenges and the opportunities for research that they offer.&lt;br/&gt;2. Research priorities of the operational centers.&lt;br/&gt;3. Observations and observing strategies.&lt;br/&gt;4. Tropical cyclone model development.&lt;br/&gt;5. Transitioning research to operations.&lt;br/&gt;6. Advances in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is important to the United States because it brings the academic research community together with Federal agencies, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the US's hurricane forecasting and warning program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research (OFCM) hosted the 2019 Tropical Cyclone Operations and Research Forum (TCORF)/73rd Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference (IHC) for Federal agencies, operational forecast centers; weather modelers; aerial, ocean, satellite, and radar observing groups; supporting research functions, and user communities. The 122 registered participants convened at the Rosenstiel School for Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) on March 12-13, 2019 to review last year’s hurricane challenges, plan operations for the upcoming season, and discuss research efforts in the context of operational needs. The agenda comprised a combination of themed sessions and the Working Group for Tropical Cyclone Operations and Research (WG/TCORF) meeting. Slide presentation used by panelists and other participants are availabe on the OFCM website.   Opening Session: Mr. Michael Bonadonna, Federal Coordinator for Meteorology opened the forum by welcoming the participants and reviewing the forum goals and agenda.  Mr. Bonadonna thanked the National Weather Service, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research for assistance in the funding the forum.   The National Hurrican Center notes that the 2018 season was very busy and impactful.   The NHC/Tropical Analysis and Forecase Branch provided meteorological analysis, forecasts and warings for ship traffic over the tropical and subtropical ocreans.  The Central Pacific Hurricane Center summarized the track and intensity characteristics and impacts of the six TCs that developed or moved through the Central Pacific in 2018.  The Joint Typhoon Warning Center experienced the highest number of Western North Pacific troprical cyclones since 1996.  AOC: Only a a single P-3 was availalbe during the 2018 season becasue of the re-winging schedule, however, it flew 95% of its allocated hours.  The 53 Weather Reconnaissance Squadron flew 145 NHOP tased hours with a reliability of 88%.  The 2020 TCORF is tentatively scheduled for March 10-11, 2020 at the AOC facility, Lakeland, FL with an alternative location at Florida International University, in Miami, Florida.  Slide presentations used by panelists and other participants are available on the OFCM website.  A separate Record of Actions (ROA) covers Hurricane Working Group and is available on OFCM’s website.          Last Modified: 12/23/2019       Submitted by: Hanne Mauriello]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
