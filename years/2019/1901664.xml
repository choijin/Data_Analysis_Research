<AbstractNarration>The 34th Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications (SUMTOPO 2019) will take place in Johannesburg, South Africa, July 1 - 4, 2019  with sessions from diverse areas of topology. New this year is the session on topology in data science, complimenting the NSF "big idea" of Harnessing Data for 21st Century Science and Engineering. At SUMTOPO 2019, we will bring together established researchers, early career faculty, and students from all over the world to make progress on the unsolved foundational problems in mathematics while also applying our topological expertise to other areas of mathematics and other fields of study. In particular, mathematicians are using topological methods to understand the structure of data. Results presented at the conference can be of use to disciplines in which big data forms an important part. A main goal of the conference series is to promote participation of young researchers by making room for many contributed talks and also by highlighting young researchers as semi-plenary speakers. Organizers continue to recruit women and other under-resented groups to the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's SUMTOPO will include plenary speakers and daily sessions in the areas of set-theoretic topology, continuum theory and dynamics, asymmetric structures and order, topological algebra and analysis, and topology in data science. This grant will support the travel of US-based participants who are students, early in their career, have no other travel support, or are members of an under-represented population. The featured lectures will highlight cutting edge research in each of the represented areas while the sessions provide a vibrant and welcoming space for researchers, established and new, to share ideas and form connections. The conference webpage is: https://www.sumtopo2019.co.za/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Topological Algebra and Analysis  Taras Banakh (Ivan Franko Lviv National University, Ukraine) discussed notions of completeness of topologized posets, and surveyed some recent results on closedness properties of complete topologized semi-lattices. Mahmoud Filali (University of Oulu, Finland) presented on algebra in the Stone-Cech compactification versus algebra in Banach algebras with an Arens product.  Francesco Russo (University of Cape Town, South Africa) described three theorems of structure for locally compact near abelian groups.  Asymmetric Structures and Order  Aysymmetric structures has been an important part of the summer conference since the beginning and has a particularly strong group in Africa. Szymon Dolecki (Burgundy University, France) talked about pseudopaving number of dual spaces comparing its strength to the topological framework.
