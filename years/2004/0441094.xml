<AbstractNarration>This proposal describes an engineered solution to providing high capacity, high performance, leading-edge network services between the U.S. and Europe. Specifically, connections are proposed connecting Chicago, New York, and Amsterdam. The proposal leverages existing partnerships with SURFnet in the Netherlands and expertise and experience from years of engineering and running the StarLight facility in providing in this proposal production-level international network connection services spanning the IP layer through "wavelength" services at Layer 1.  The StarLight facility in Chicago is used, as is the new ManLan facility in New York City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
