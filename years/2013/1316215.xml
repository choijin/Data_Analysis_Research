<AbstractNarration>This action funds Carson J. Bruns of Northwestern University to conduct a research project in Math and Physical Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.  The project title is "Programming Simple Molecules to Self-Assemble into Well-Defined Nanoparticles with Intricate Hierarchical Architectures." The host scientist is Professor Makoto Fujita.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'bottom-up' strategies to nanotechnology, which carry the banners of self-assembly, supramolecular chemistry, and molecular nanotechnology, are often highly sensitive to experimental conditions or limited by serendipitous discovery. Scientific breakthroughs in this field will be marked by research that describes ways to self-assemble increasingly intricate nano-objects in a more rational, predictable, robust, and well-defined manner. Toward this end, the award supports the development of self-assembled metallo-organic molecular nanoparticles known as M12L24 spheres (where M is a metal ion and L is an organic ligand) to serve as a platform around which to orchestrate the hierarchical self-assembly of more complex molecular architectures. This goal is realized by installing functional groups on the ligands that have the capacity for molecular recognition, which allow them to participate in multiple compatible modes of self-assembly that span a spectrum of strengths and length scales, and include the self-assembly of 'molecular machine' prototypes such as mechanically interlocked molecules known as catenanes, rotaxanes, and pseudorotaxanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the Fellow disseminates and enhances scientific understanding to a broad audience by sharing the EAPSI experience at international research conferences and at collaborating national laboratories in both Japan and the United States. The Fellow will extend the benefits of this international research experience to younger students by mentoring undergraduates in related research at the host institution.</AbstractNarration>
