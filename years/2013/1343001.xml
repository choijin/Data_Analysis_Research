<AbstractNarration>Abstract: This project will design a "Cloud Management System (CMS)" that provides a uniform way to acquire and control a wide range of resources from compute to storage to network, and from the data center to the network edge but do so at multiple levels of abstraction.  The project will create a data model (a set of abstract objects, operations on those objects, and relationships among objects) that collectively defines how users interact with the underlying research cloud.   The CMS unifies the underlying cloud resource substrate and presents widely different classes of users with customized projections and extensions of those resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will demonstrate the feasibility of the CMS by addressing the biggest risk to its success:  defining a set of abstractions-in the form of an operational data model-that both (a) unifies the research cloud?s diverse hardware resources, and (b) supports widely different usage models. These abstractions form the heart of the CMS, but they must satisfy two competing objectives. On the one hand, the CMS provides a unified interface to a widely diverse set of compute and network resources, spanning many autonomous hosting sites, each with their own operational policies. On the other hand, thousands of users want to access the system in significantly different ways, ranging from traditional cloud users that just want a set of VM instances, to cloud researchers that want to create new cloud architectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cloud Computing is rapidly changing the face of computing infrastructure and is a major economic driver in the technology sector. This project will benefit the cloud computing industry by informing the design of future cloud computing infrastructure and contributing prototype implementations to the Openstack community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OpenCloud is a pilot value-added cloud being built jointly by Internet2, the Open Networking Lab, the PlanetLab Consortium, and a collection of participating Universities. OpenCloud does not attempt to replace or replicate existing cloud resources, but instead augments commodity clouds and University-hosted private clouds with widely distributed cloud resources that take advantage of the Internet2's global footprint.  OpenCloud adds value to existing cloud services by leveraging Internet2Æs footprint, including its national backbone, international co-location centers, and edge sites on University campuses. Doing so gives the Internet2 community an opportunity to provide value along six dimensions:   Responsiveness &ndash; deliver low-latency access to end-users.   Bandwidth &ndash; avoid upstream bottlenecks and transfer costs.  Predictability &ndash; offer compute, memory, and bandwidth guarantees.  Privacy &ndash; keep sensitive data on the University premises.  Trust &ndash; spread risk over multiple commodity providers.   Customization &ndash; tailor access for targeted user communities.    To complement this global footprint, OpenCloud also provides an open service framework that lowers the barrier to deploying new services and supporting the rapid customization of existing services for targeted user communities. This framework encourages innovation above commercial IaaS APIs by supporting service-aware abstractions that are essential to catalyzing and sustaining a rich service ecosystem. At the same time, OpenCloud makes it possible to fully control virtual machine placement and customize virtual network behavior across multiple tiers of cloud resources. This level of control encourages innovation below available IaaS APIs by enabling network-aware services that can position functionality at the optimal point in the network.  OpenCloud is open to all possible sources of value-added services, including community initiatives that target R&amp;E use cases (e.g., scientific discovery, course delivery), cutting-edge services developed by the research community (e.g., Internet-of-Things, virtual networks on demand), and commercial over-the-top-services that can provide even more value if given access to Internet2Æs footprint (e.g., Content Distribution Networks, Virtual Private Networks).
