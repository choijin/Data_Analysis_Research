<AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Multi-Functional Integrated System Technology &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1338901 University of Florida; Nishida &lt;br/&gt;1338895 University of Central Florida; Yuan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of the proposed Center "Multi-Functional Integrated System Technology (MIST) is to pioneer the More than Moore" era by translating novel materials, devices, and manufacturing processes into multi-functional integrated systems that yield rich functional diversity compared to traditional integrated circuit platforms. The University of Florida (UFL) and the University of Central Florida (UCF) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UFL as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center aims at the innovation beyond Moore's Law. Through iindustry-driven collaborative research initiatives, interdisciplinary mixing and intersectional collisions will be promoted in order to catalyze innovation opportunities such as combinations of computing, sensing, actuation, and energy storage/generation on the same system on a chip (SoC) or system in package (SiP). The MIST Center will lay the pavement on the roadmap to next-generation integrated electronic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A result of Moore's law is the transformation of the computing platform from the advent of the solid-state mainframe computer to the desktop computer to the laptop computer, and most recently to the tablet computer. Research at the MIST Center will operate at the forefront of this transformation by connecting research advances in materials science, electronics, magnetics, acoustics, photonics, microfluidic devices, MEMS, and circuits to societally relevant technologies with industry guidance. The proposed I/UCRC MIST Center will integrate a strong team of complementary investigators, train the next generation of graduate students who are versed in cutting edge research, actively recruit and introduce participants from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, and team with industrial member companies, governmental agencies, and associations. These exchanges will broaden the perspectives of all involved participants.</AbstractNarration>
