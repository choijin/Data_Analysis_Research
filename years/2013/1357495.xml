<AbstractNarration>This project examines the effects of different international relationships on electric power plant CO2 emission rates and levels, by assessing how global and national social factors combine with the organizational characteristics of individual power plants to shape emission outcomes, and investigates how the conjoint effects of organizational and global factors on plants? carbon emissions may vary by the national regulatory systems that mediate them.  This project addresses three research questions: Which sets of organizational, world-system, and world society structures determine fossil fuel power plants' CO2 emission rates? Which sets of these structures cause plants' emission rates to improve over time but their emission levels to worsen?  And to what extent can the effects of organizational and global factors on plants' emission outcomes be explained by the regulatory systems of plants' host nations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer these questions, this project will use newly released data compiled by the Center for Global Development on the carbon emissions and structural characteristics of over 20,000 power plants throughout the world. It will employ multi-level regression techniques in conjunction with novel fuzzy set analytic (fsQCA) methods that can identify which combinations of factors are associated with an outcome. Consistent with the literature on structural configurations, we hypothesize that plants with high CO2 emission rates and levels share certain combinations of organizational, world-system, and world society structures and the effectiveness of national environmental policies will depend on plants' structural profiles. This project seeks to provide new information on the structural sources of CO2 emissions, and it will advance world-systems, world society, and organizational research on the environment that to date have been typically treated as competing rather than complementary perspectives.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's findings will help to develop a sector-based strategy to mitigating CO2 emissions, and findings should help determine the standards met by power plants around the world. Findings may also be of interest to the electricity industry, as it may become possible to target future regulatory initiatives at specific subsets of power plants. Finally, project results could support industry initiatives to optimize self-regulation and environmental performance of member facilities. The project also includes training for a graduate student research assistant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The electricity sector is the largest source of heat-trapping pollutants, accounting for a quarter of all CO2 emissions. Despite improvements in their electricity-based CO2 emission rates, developing countriesÆ emission levels have risen dramatically in recent years, indicative of so-called "rebound effects."  While world-systems and world society perspectives have stressed the effects of different international relationships on emission rates and levels, neither has examined how these global factors combine with the organizational characteristics of individual power plants to shape emission outcomes.  Nor have they investigated how the conjoint effects of organizational and global factors on plantsÆ carbon emissions may vary by the national regulatory systems that mediate them.    This project addresses three research questions: Which sets of organizational, world-system, and world society structures determine fossil fuel power plantsÆ CO2 emission rates? Which sets of these structures cause plantsÆ emission rates to improve over time but their emission levels to worsen?  And to what extent can the effects of organizational and global factors on plantsÆ emission outcomes be explained by the regulatory systems of plantsÆ host nations?  To answer these questions, this project uses newly released data compiled by the Center for Global Development on the carbon emissions and structural characteristics of over 20,000 fossil fuel power plants throughout the world.  And it employs multi-level regression techniques in conjunction with novel fuzzy set analytic (fsQCA) methods that can identify which combinations of factors are associated with an outcome. Consistent with the literature on structural configurations, we hypothesize that plants with high CO2 emission rates and levels share certain combinations of organizational, world-system, and world society structures and the effectiveness of national environmental policies will depend on plantsÆ structural "profiles."    So far, the project has produced one publication, which appeared in the Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences.  This paper analyzes the distribution of CO2 emissions and intensities within countriesÆ electricity sectors.  Findings reveal that the dirtiest 5% of power plants are responsible for huge shares of their sectors' total emissions. If these plants continued generating the same amount of electricity but met particular intensity targets, the worldÆs total electricity-based CO2 emissions could be reduced by as much as 44%.  Two other papers have been submitted to journals and are currently under review.  The first explores how the effect of plantsÆ thermal efficiency on their CO2 emissions varies by plantsÆ age, size, and location in global economic and normative systems.  Results indicate that each of these factors has a significant interaction with efficiency and thus shapes environmentally destructive rebound effects.  The second looks at how global factors emphasized by world-systems and world society scholars combine with the organizational characteristics of power plants to shape emission outcomes. We find that while organizational factors like size and age as well as global ones like position in the world-system and exposure to environmental international non-governmental organizations exert significant, independent effects on plantsÆ emissions, none of these factors, by themselves, is sufficient to explain plantsÆ environmental behavior.  Instead, plantsÆ emissions are best explained by three distinct combinations of these factors.   We are in the initial stages of the next research paper out of this project, where we are calculating Gini coefficients (a common measure of inequality) of power plant emissions for each nation. These coefficients will allow for assessing the extent to which power plants within a nation differentially contribute to carbon emissions from this sector. We will then treat the Gini coefficients as dependent variables in s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
