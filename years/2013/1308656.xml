<AbstractNarration>This action funds Jeffrey S. Pigott of The Ohio State University to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at Curtin University in Perth, WA, Australia.  The project title is "Calculation of the Water Storage Capacity of Garnets in the Earth's Deep Interior." The host scientists are Professor Kate Wright and Professor Julian Gale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study addresses the Earth's water budget by calculating the water storage capacity of garnet, a mineral found in the Earth's upper mantle (~60 km - 410 km depth) and transition zone (410 km - 660 km depth). Garnet accounts for as much as 40 percent of the rock volume at 500 km.  The water storage capacity of garnet depends on the mechanism by which the crystal structure incorporates hydrogen and is also a function of pressure, temperature, and garnet composition.  At low pressures, hydrogen can substitute for silicon in the garnet structure and has been termed the hydrogarnet substitution.  It is likely that the hydrogarnet substitution becomes less energetically favored when compared to other mechanisms at greater depths due to pressure.  This study calculates the energetics of different defect mechanisms to pressures equivalent to 660-km depth for garnets in the pyrope-almandine system.  The disseminated results of this work will compliment experimental studies and can be used by geodynamicists, geochemists, mineral physicists, and seismologists that model and predict the state and evolution of the Earth's mantle. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the Fellow plans to publish the results of this research in peer-reviewed journals and present at international conferences as well as departmental seminars and colloquia at both Curtin University and The Ohio State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outer shell (~100km) of the Earth is composed of rigid, mobile plates whose movements are explained through the unifying theory of plate tectonics.  The motion of these plates is generated by solid-state deformation of the underlying rock driven by density variations due to compositional and thermal heterogeneities.  The structure, dynamics, and composition of EarthÆs deep interior have direct control on plate tectonics and surface-to-interior exchange of material, including water and carbon. Water has a first-order effect on the compressibility and deformation of the crust and mantle.  Water is stored in deep crustal rocks as hydrogen defects bound to oxygen within the crystal structures. The amount of water stored in deep crustal and mantle rocks is largely unconstrained, and may account for a quantity of water comparable to or in excess of the amount contained in the present oceans.  The fundamental question of the planetÆs water budget has implications for the formation history of the planet and the cycling of volatile compounds between the surface and the interior.   Majorite garnet accounts for as much as 40% of the rock volume at 500 km depth in the earth. Determination of the degree to which major mantle mineral phases such as majorite garnet, participate in the global water cycle is crucial for understanding the cycling of material at depth and the dynamic processes that give rise to plate tectonics at the surface.  To properly interpret geophysical data of the EarthÆs interior, experimentally derived data need to be augmented by computational modeling of physiochemical properties of the minerals present. By combining modeling with experiment it is possible to provide more robust interpretation of geophysical data than would be possible with either technique alone.  This research project involved the use of atomistic computer simulation methods to calculate the energetics of two different hydrogen incorporation mechanisms in garnet (MgSiO3) to pressures associated with a depth of ~700 km. Charge-balanced substitutions of hydrogen for magnesium or silicon, [VSi(OH)4]X and [VMg(OH)2]X, were investigated. Additionally, the associated geophysical properties (P- and S-wave velocities) were calculated. Comparison of the defect energies show that the hydrogarnet defect, [VSi(OH)4]X , should be the most favorable in the garnet structure.  This configuration supports the upper bound of observed majorite water contents.  The elasticity and resulting seismic wave speeds associated with H defects were calculated and show that hydrous majorite needs to be considered when interpreting lateral variations in seismic wave speeds in EarthÆs mantle.  Broader impacts of my EAPSI fellowship included a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of Australia in general and Curtin University in Perth, WA, specifically; and an orientation to the society and culture of Australia.   These activities served to educate me for international collaborations early in my scientific career, thus ensuring that I am prepared to join a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  The results of this research are being presented at the international 2014 American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA.  A manuscript is in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.   Additionally, this research was presented at the Computational Chemistry seminar at Curtin University.
