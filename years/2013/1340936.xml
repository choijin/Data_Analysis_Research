<AbstractNarration>The University of Pennsylvania's central computing organization is partnering with leading campus researchers in engineering, physics, biology, pathology, genomics, bioinformatics, and computer science to optimize the campus network in support of big data research and high-performance computing. This project establishes a 100 Gbps-capable Science DMZ that is distinct from the general purpose campus network and is engineered for research applications. Additionally, it extends 10 Gbps connectivity to select research projects and increases Penn's connection to Internet2 from 1 Gbps to 100 Gbps, while also extending that connection to the Science DMZ. The project also lays the foundation for further enhancements to research networking infrastructure by extending IPv6 capabilities; upgrading network monitoring tools such as perfSONAR; and enhancing Penn's ability to support experimental networks and network architectures, including OpenFlow and Software Defined Networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will benefit a range of scientifically meritorious research. It will provide support for the large-scale data transfer, processing, and storage needs of researchers across Penn, while supporting intra- and inter-institutional collaborations and the broad dissemination of research results.  Rather than focusing on the logistics of data storage and transfer, researchers will be able to concentrate on the transformation of these data into the information that will drive new discoveries and the creation of new technologies, drugs, therapies, and cures. Network enhancements will also support Penn's commitment to integrating research and education by supporting the network needs of the cross-disciplinary Penn Institute for Computation Science that where faculty actively integrate computation-based research with the training of future generations of STEM researchers.</AbstractNarration>

Extend 10 Gbps connectivity to selected research projects, with the capability to upgrade to 100 Gbps. Upgrade PennÆs connection to Internet2 from 1 Gbps to 100 Gbps and extend that connection to the Science DMZ. Optimize the network to support the broader use of advanced networking and measurement tools such as perfSONAR, IPv6, SDN, and OpenFlow.   (See Figure 1 for diagram of upgraded campus network)      As the centrality of big data to todayÆs research enterprise continues to grow, high-performance cyberinfrastructure has become a strategic necessity for research universities. Much of the work carried out by PennÆs science, biomedical, and engineering communities requires access to high-performance national and international networks, large data repositories, and facilities for high-performance and data intensive computing, as well as the ability to collaborate with institutions around the country and across the world. This project advances PennÆs research mission by:     Supporting the large-scale data transfer, processing, and storage needs of researchers across the University and optimizing the campus network for intra- and inter-institutional collaborations. Leveraging PennÆs existing networking architecture, including its existing NSF-funded Advanced Layer 2 services, while laying the foundation for further upgrades to the campus research networking infrastructure. Upgrading PennÆs ability to support experimental networks and network architectures. Enabling the frictionless flow of researcher data to servers on campus and to remote sites without impacting other University business.     This project has resulted in dramatically enhanced connectivity and data transfer speeds that benefit multiple research collaborations in fields, ranging from materials science to genomics to high energy physics.  It has "future-proofed" PennÆs cyberinfrastructure by delivering an agile, scalable network with the capacity to continue to deliver cutting edge performance in the face of increasing bandwidth demands and new and larger use cases. Enhanced network monitoring capabilities will support ongoing optimization by enabling the rapid diagnosis of any problems and by profiling network performance to determine how far researchers can push computing and transmission functions.
