<AbstractNarration>This grant supports participation of approximately 22 US dissertation-stage doctoral students in the Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) doctoral consortium to be held at the Academy of Management meeting in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, in August 2013.  The OCIS doctoral consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the Academy of Management conference since 2000, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding researchers in organizational communication and information systems.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their research during the workshop, and will receive feedback from a faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other OCIS research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The annual OCIS doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of researchers in organizational communication and information systems, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is OCIS-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees.  Participants will be a diverse group with regard to their research topics, methods, backgrounds, and the kinds of institutions they attend.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported a consortium of promising doctoral students and distinguished research faculty. It was held in conjunction with the 2013 Academy of Management Annual Meeting.  The Academy of Management (AOM) is organized in several divisions, each focused on a different area of interest to management researchers (e.g., organizational behavior, strategy and business policy, gender and diversity, etc.).  This consortium was conducted by the Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) division.  The OCIS tracks at the annual AOM meetings provide a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practical issues related to the use and impact of information and communication technologies in organizations. The Academy of Management has more than 16,000 members, of whom 1000 (approximately) are currently affiliated with the OCIS division. AOM meetings are attended by more than 6,000 researchers, professionals, and students.  All papers submitted for presentation at AOM are peer-reviewed, and the Academy of Management Conference Proceedings publishes approximately the top 10% of those papers.  Most faculty and student members of the Academy focus their participation in the conference on the activities sponsored by the one or two divisions with which their interests are most closely aligned.  Thus many divisions offer complementary activities for doctoral students, including several divisionsÆ doctoral consortia.  These activities are scheduled concurrently during the first two days of the conference, which are devoted to professional development workshops.  PhD students will therefore generally apply to attend the doctoral consortium of the division that is most closely related to their interests.     A major focus of the doctoral consortium is discussion of the studentsÆ dissertation projects.  These represent cutting-edge research in the field of organizational communication and information systems.  The consortium provides both an opportunity for these projects to be shaped through intellectual exchange as well as communicating the work to a key group of young scholars.  The following goals of the doctoral consortium were met with aplomb:  To build a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of  diverse colleagues spread out across the world;     To  guide the work of the new researchers by having the experts in the research field give advice;  To provide encouragement and support for the selection of OCIS research topics;  To make it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference;  To illustrate the interrelationship and diversity of OCIS research;  To make the new entrantsÆ experience at the AOM conference an enjoyable and rewarding experience, encouraging them to return and submit papers, panels, demonstrations, posters, etc. to the conference.
