<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop self-generated bioluminescence in zebrafish to create improved models for new drug discovery, therapeutic testing, and biomedical disease imaging. Zebrafish share many common anatomical, developmental, and physiological features with humans, including disease pathologies and drug metabolism effects, and serve as ideal models for understanding how drugs and other chemicals facilitate disease management as well as cause harm through unidentified side-effects. The objectives of this research effort are to express the bacterial luciferase genes in zebrafish to create autonomously bioluminescent zebrafish models capable of delineating the biological and metabolic effects of human/drug interactions. The self-generation of bioluminescence in zebrafish is anticipated to enable higher-throughput screening assays to generate data in real time, faster, and in larger quantities than previously possible, thereby accelerating the pace of new drug discovery while reducing associated costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be to improve pharmaceutical drug discovery and efficacy testing, and to facilitate better human and animal disease management. Small and rapidly growing zebrafish function to reduce space and maintenance requirements, thus lowering the costs associated with pharmaceutical research and new drug discovery while decreasing the industry's reliance on animals for laboratory testing. Scientific and technological understanding in the biomedical fields will be enhanced due to massively data-rich higher-throughput screening for drug action and disease therapies. Ancillary to these applications will be similar zebrafish screening strategies relevant to the detection and surveillance of chemical contaminants in the environment for the assurance of clean and safe water to better meet growing societal needs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The objective of this project was to integrate a fully self-contained, genetically modified bacterial luciferase gene cassette into the zebrafish genome to develop fish that continuously produce visible light from every cell in their bodies. Through the use of specific genetic controls, the amount of light produced by this cassette can be programmed to automatically adjust and become brighter or dimmer to reflect positive or negative changes in the fish&rsquo;s health. Therefore, by simply recording the level of light being produced over time, one can obtain a real-time visual representation of health that allows each fish to be used as an innovative and high-throughput screening model for advancing drug discovery and toxicology research. As a result of this project, we have developed a first-of-its-kind zebrafish that continuously produces light within the visible spectrum without any external stimulation required. The zebrafish was chosen for this project in place of a more common mouse model because, while they both share many disease-related features with humans, zebrafish have a significantly faster growth rate, are less expensive to house and use, and large numbers of zebrafish can be evaluated simultaneously using automated equipment. When combined with our unique, fully self-contained light-producing genetic technology, these zebrafish can therefore be evaluated under high-throughput conditions to produce more data at a lower cost, while still providing information on the subject&rsquo;s health that remains relevant to human diseases to aid in the screening of potentially toxic compounds and new therapeutic drugs. In addition, these light-producing zebrafish are not just limited to use in the pharmaceutical industry. By genetically altering the regulation of light production to link it with tissue- and disease-specific biomarkers, these zebrafish can similarly impact many related fields such as developmental biology, cancer research, immunology, neurobiology, and toxicology by allowing for real-time visualization of disease progression at the whole organism level. Similarly, when modified to initiate light production only in response to specific chemicals, these same fish can become living sensors for the real-time detection of environmental contaminants like heavy metals or industrial pollution, reproductive hazards like endocrine disrupting chemicals, or even bio-terrorism agents. Although they are just small fish, through their production of light they are ready to make a big impact on health monitoring, drug discovery, environmental security, water quality, and public safety.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/18/2015<br>      Modified by: Dan&nbsp;Morrison</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1345896/1345896_10286236_1421433461936_Lightproducingzebrafish--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1345896/1345896_10286236_1421433461936_Lightproducingzebrafish--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Self-contained light producing zebrafish"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1345896/1345896_10286236_1421433461936_Lightproducingzebrafish--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Self-contained light producing zebrafish"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">By expressing the bacterial luciferase gene cassette, the genetically modified zebrafish is capable of producing a light signal continuously without any external stimulation.</div> <div class="imageCredit">490 BioTech Inc.</...]]></DRECONTENT>
