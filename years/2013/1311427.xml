<AbstractNarration>1311427&lt;br/&gt;Fotiyeva&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Howard University  multimedia educational pilot project will design, develop, and test an innovative science education model and materials to motivate high school students in grades 10-11 to become interested in pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education by learning physics, astronomy, and cosmology (PAC)  in multi-modal innovative ways. To accomplish this, the PAC - Involved pilot project team is combining the best features of formal and informal education along with the educative resources offered by networked computing, popular media, and information technologies. The main goal of the project is to pilot test key methods and designs to develop a new learning model that could provide essential science content preparation together with enhancing students? motivation to enroll and succeed in regular high school physics and astronomy courses, which are gateways to college level STEM courses and careers. Over a 2-year period, the PAC - Involved team will design, develop, and test a new learning environment and will work with 30 high school students from the Washington Metropolitan Area Public School Systems.</AbstractNarration>
