<AbstractNarration>This project will build upon the successful development of models, algorithms, and software for planning and job scheduling systems developed during previous NSF research. The product is designed to allow organizations to schedule their operations in real-time and generate the optimal plan to maximize their operational targets. Through prior research, the project team created new planning and scheduling algorithms, a software prototype, and successful empirical studies using the newly developed methodology of Nested Partitions. After creating and proving this methodology, the team plans to further develop the technology for widespread use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed scheduling and planning tool could enable companies to communicate, collaborate, and integrate their planning and scheduling functionalities to obtain optimal results throughout their enterprise and their entire supply chain. It is expected that coordinated use of these tools could eventually create an integrated cyber-infrastructure for American manufacturing firms and create more efficient supply chains through the use of effective scheduling that will enable these firms to be more competitive and flexible in the global marketplace.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The technology our team investigated during the 2013 summer I-Corps cohort was a scheduling software. Our software applies a set of starte-of-the-art optimzation framework to determine the best schedule for a set of manufacturing resources, operators, and jobs.     The current solutions are not capable of managing the complexity of the problem, and the increasing amount of data coming in. The complexity of the problem and simplicity in current solutions lead a factory to operate at a sub-par performance level, and spend more resources on managing the scheduling process.     By leveraging state-of-the-art optimization techniques, our solution can handle the increasing complexity and information flows of the current and future Manufacturing Industry. By operating to a more effective schedule, factories should see improvements in lead time, capacity, inventory, and a reduction in waste. Through the use of a cloud framework, our software can greatly reduce the amount of resources required to schedule and manage the scheduling process, allowing the business to operate more effectively.     During our time in I-Corps, we interviewed over 80 discrete manufacturers, and were able to learn a great deal from our interactions. Perhaps the most powerful outcome is that we learned as technologists how to take control of our product, and guide it to the correct customer. Before starting I-Corps we thought we knew who our software was good for, would market to them, and when they turned us away we didnÆt understand why ; how hard is it to sell performance increases we thought. However, by interviewing customers and fitting them into Hypothesis categories, we were able to better understand our market landscape.     Coming out of the I-Corps program we learned more about our customers than we had in the past years.

We are working with them to explore the topic further, and determine if we can work together to deploy our solution.     Development of our software has continued, but we have identified "versions" that fit the Hypothesis we formed and validated. While some elements of the software are consistent across all customer groups, there are certain needs unique to a group.     A very large outcome of our participation in this program has been the formation of a new Manufacturing System, Next Generation Lean (NGL).

A new concept that evolved as part of this program is applying NGL to a supply chain strategy. Meaning within a supply chain, suppliers are expected to measure NGL metrics and are rated on their performance related to these metrics and ability to reduce waste.     With the development of NGL, the PI has started a seminar course to explore teaching this new system at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, under the title Modern Operations Management. This class will focus on teaching students the skills they need to perform as management in a Manufacturing environment, to understand system performance and waste, and to deploy or create tools to systematically reduce and control waste. Part of this class also involves meeting with local companies ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
