<AbstractNarration>When children are eyewitnesses to crime, their initial reports typically are not to the authorities. Rather, children likely first disclose crucial information to parents.  When parents discuss shared past events with their children, an elaborative conversation style is associated with children's accurate, detailed memory reports. In contrast, parental bias and misinformation can lead to children's false reports. However, little is known about children's initial discussions with caregivers following an event witnessed only by children. Even less evidence exists about how caregivers' pre-conceived notions affect their discussion style. The proposed research will examine parent-child conversations about an unshared event and associations with children's memory accuracy. In addition, the effect of biasing information on both parent conversational style and children's memory will be examined.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;132 parent-child dyads will come to the laboratory where the 3- to 6-year-olds will experience a play session, while their parents wait outside. Parents will be randomly assigned  to one of three experimental conditions: biased (given false information about the play session), nonbiased (given no false information about the play session), or irrelevant (discuss a separate event). Parents in the biased and nonbiased conditions will be instructed to find out as much as possible about what occurred. Finally, for all groups, children's memory for the play session will be tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New knowledge will be gained about parent-child conversations by examining how parents discuss past events about which  children are the "experts." In addition children's eyewitness memory research will be extended by investigating effects of biased parental interviewing on children's memory. This research is relevant to forensic settings. Forensic interviewing techniques are becoming scientifically based, leaving little room for misinformation and suggestion. The present research will extend beyond professional interviewing, to explore how initial disclosures to parents may be sources of memory error.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  When children are eyewitnesses to crime, their initial reports often occur in the absence of legal authorities.  Rather, children likely disclose crucial information to caregivers.  The ensuing initial discussion of eyewitness information is critical for childrenÆs later memory reports.  Attorneys often point to childrenÆs initial conversations with family members as sources of contamination and misleading information. However, we know little about the nature of these conversations. The present research aimed to investigate parent-child conversations about events experienced only by children (3- to 6-year-olds), and how parental biases and individual differences may influence these conversations and childrenÆs subsequent eyewitness memory reports.   The funds from this NSF award permitted recruitment of 77 parent-child dyads from the community for a 2-hour, one-visit session. The dyads were individually tested. Parent and child arrived at the laboratory and were greeted by two researchers.  After full consent was obtained, the parent and child were separated.  While the child was cared for, the parent was introduced to the two experimenters who would be playing with the child. Then the caregiver went into the laboratoryÆs lobby to complete the parent-report measures.  The child joined the two experimenters in the playroom where the child engaged in a series of structured games (e.g., Simon Says, puzzles) with one of the two experimenters.   When the play session was finished, the parent-child dyad was randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: a biased discussion of the target play event (n = 23), a non-biased discussion of the target play event (n = 25), and a discussion of an event irrelevant to the target play event (n = 22).  For the biased discussion group, one of the two researchers stormed past the parent in the lobby and angrily declared "I hate this place!" before slamming the door and exiting the building.  In the second and third experimental conditions (the non-biased and irrelevant discussion conditions), no experimenter showed anger or exited the session.  In the biased and nonbiased conditions, the parent was asked to find out what happened during the play session. In the irrelevant discussion condition, the parent was instructed to discuss the car ride to the laboratory with the child and avoid any conversation about the play session.  (Note that nothing aversive had actually happened in front of or to the child during the play session.) Next, the child and parent were reunited and engaged in the conversation. Following the conclusion of the discussion, the parent and child were again separated and administered a series of measures and questionnaires. This included that the child was given a memory interview about the target play session.    Results indicated that when parents are exposed to negative, false information prior to conversations with their children, certain parents are more likely than others to engage in suggestive and misleading questioning of their 3- to 6-year-old children.  Specifically, parents who self-identify as more anxiously attached engaged in more elaborative discussion when they were exposed to biasing information. It is likely that these parents became hypervigilent when faced with a situation in which their children could be upset. As a result, they discussed the event in more detail and provided a significant amount of their own elaborative input.  Additionally, parents in the biased condition who self-reported as fearfully attached (an attachment orientation classified as both highly anxious and highly avoidant) introduced significantly more misinformation in their conversations with their children, suggesting that high avoidance and high anxiety may result in a heightened reaction to the moderate stressor and caused the parents to utilize a more misleading and suggestive questioning technique when attempting to gain information from their children.
