<AbstractNarration>Dr. Montfort is studying the similarities and differences between how engineers and engineering students categorize what they know.  Existing research in the fields of conceptual change and personal epistemology show that learning and the application of what is learned both depend on the ways in which the new knowledge is organized.  This work utilizes the construct of domains as a means to investigate the organizations of participants' knowledge at a meaningful grain size.  In this investigation practicing engineers are asked to describe the domains of knowledge applied to real multi-disciplinary projects they have been engaged in.  Students are also interviewed about the domains of knowledge involved in these projects.  Thematic analysis based on an interactional approach to personal epistemology provides a means to compare the domains of knowing between the engineers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it has not been firmly established yet, existing research suggests that students' domains of knowing do more to interfere with the application of their knowledge than to facilitate it.  In other words, the way students organize what they know may be interfering with how able they are to apply it.  Where an experienced engineer might see a cohesive domain of knowledge -- such as "process engineering" for example  -- engineering students may instead see an arbitrary grouping of otherwise dissimilar skills and ideas.  Previous research emphasizes how students struggle to learn the concepts of engineering, and treats the application of that knowledge as a separate (if closely related) problem.  This work develops a potentially transformative new way of looking at it by focusing on the organization processes that control both how something is learned and how it is applied.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In an effort to improve the way we educate engineers, this project studied engineering knowledge itself. We studied how knowledge is a social process &ndash; something that happens between people, rather than something that just exists.  Drawing from a broad range of academic disciplines including philosophy, cognitive science, psychology and human development, we studied what we call "knowledge in practice."  We observed engineers at work.  We focused our investigation on how engineers and students organized the boundaries of their knowledge.  Studying these boundaries is helpful because it can be a way to study different types of knowledge (like how it’s easy to step between states once you locate the precise border).  We studied engineers working on complex interdisciplinary problems so that we would be sure to observe a lot of knowledge boundaries.  We also interviewed those engineers about their work on the project, and asked them to help us explain the boundaries of their knowledge.  For each participant, we tried to figure out how they understood their specific expertise, and how it related to the other engineers’ areas.  The interviews were designed to work with the participants to produce data that we could analyze to answer our research questions about the participants’ knowledge boundaries. We found that the engineers experience the boundaries of their knowledge in an interpersonal way, defining them in terms of interdisciplinary collaborations. We also designed these interviews so that we could reproduce portions of them with engineering students. In contrast with the engineers, students’ viewed their knowledge boundaries as fixed and standardized disciplines (e.g. chemistry or biology).  They talked about knowledge as a thing that could be found, possessed, and transported.  These approaches seem ill suited to the collaborative, uncertain world they will face as engineers.  As part of this work we developed some suggestions for engineering educators to help their students interact with their knowledge like engineers do.  This work is valuable because it will help produce better engineers more prepared to face complex problems.  Increased understanding of the structure and organization of engineering knowledge has the potential to positively change the role of engineering in society.  Understanding and demonstrating how engineering knowledge is negotiated (rather than revealed, discovered or proven) challenges common assumptions about engineering as a solely technical and meritocratic endeavor.  Such questions would open the way for consideration of the macro-ethical responsibilities of engineers in facing modern societal problems.  Issues like climate change and fossil fuel management cannot meaningfully be separated into technical and social components because such problems are essentially about both society and technology.  The existing ethical standards guiding engineers (which nearly always include some form of "do no harm" and "do not exceed your expertise") are inadequate in cases where engineering products may harm society (by contributing to climate change or limiting access to medicine based on wealth, for example).  Our small steps in developing a greater understanding of engineering knowledge are intended to prepare for those difficult discussions. Finally, work of this nature helps to demystify engineering practice and engineers.  Equitable distribution of the benefits and costs of engineering (including the benefits associated with access to engineering careers for all) depends on addressing some fundamental societal misconceptions about the nature of engineering work.  The more we understand about engineering practice as one of many similar social practices, the better able we will be to manage and share that practice for the purposes of equity and access.
