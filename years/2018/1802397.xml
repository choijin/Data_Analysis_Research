<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Atlanta Lecture Series in Graph Theory and Combinatorics, which will be held November 3-4, 2018 and March 30-31, 2019 at Georgia State University and Georgia Institute of Technology, respectively. Combinatorics and graph theory have undergone dramatic development in the past few decades. These two conferences will feature the latest research developments and themes in the areas of structural graph theory, extremal graph theory, and probabilistic combinatorics. The series has become a major event for the combinatorics community, providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and institutions within the southeast region of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each conference features two one-hour lectures by a distinguished researcher, four one-hour lectures by established researchers mainly from the southeast region, and four 30-minute talks by early-career researchers and graduate students. The meetings provide opportunities for interaction among established researchers and rising stars; this award supports the attendance of graduate students, early-career researchers, and invited speakers. Additional information concerning financial support and the conference schedule is maintained at the lecture series websites at two hosting institutions, respectively:&lt;br/&gt; http://mathstatt.gsu.edu and http://www.als.math.gatech.edu/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
