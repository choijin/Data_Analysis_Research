<AbstractNarration>This project is co-funded by OISE, Engineering (CMMI, EEC) and MPS (XC and OMA)Directorates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 1&lt;br/&gt;Nanofibers exhibit unique properties that have stimulated a massive effort in nanofibers research to address key challenges in high performance filtration, battery separators, wound healing, composites, blood vessel and tissue engineering, electrochemical sensing, smart textiles, drug delivery, and catalysis. Some recent examples include: Dermtreat's nanofibrous Rivelin patch for innovative treatment of mucosal diseases and DuPont's nanofiber-based EnergainT battery separator, which boosts up to 30% power of Li-ion batteries, just to name a few. The global market for nanofibers is expected to reach ~$2 billion by 2021, but its growth potential is hindered by limited ability of sizeable production of nanofibrous materials with predictable complex, macroscopic architectures, and desirable properties.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and graduate trainees with diverse backgrounds from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo will tackle the challenges in the nanofiber science and technology through intense real-life research on fabrication of nanofibers by an uncommon, high-yield alternating-current electrospinning (ACES) process. ACES unveils several new physical phenomena and features that significantly reduce or eliminate many disadvantages of traditional techniques while greatly increasing the productivity and simplifying material handling. All IRES trainees will gain critical international research, industry, and cultural sensitivity experiences expanding beyond each participant?s institution through the collaborative work at a number of high-profile labs and related industries in three European countries, joint presentations/publications, social activities, and interactions with diverse international student population at TUL, UT-Lodz and Aalto. The goals of this project are to accelerate innovation and increase outcomes in the nanofiber materials domain and to develop future leaders and experts capable of operating at a high level of advanced research and competence in global collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;This project brings the ongoing collaborations to a higher level and establishes new collaborations in the emerging area of fabrication and application of nanofiber materials and structures with Technical University of Liberec (TUL, Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research), Lodz U of Technology (UT-Lodz, Poland, a regional leader in heterogeneous catalysis), and  Aalto University (Finland, the #1 Finnish University with strong idea-to-industry programs in nanoscience and engineering). At least 27 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo will engage in the hands-on pre-trip training at UAB and a 8 week-long cutting-edge research at the forefront of nanofibers science and technology at those premier European institutions, followed by the long-term post trip research and outcomes dissemination activities. &lt;br/&gt;IRES trainees will fabricate nanofibers using a high-yield Alternating Current Electrospinning (ACES) process, which unveils several physical phenomena that significantly reduce or eliminate major disadvantages of traditional DC-techniques, while greatly increasing the productivity. Trainees will apply the fabricated materials to biomedical scaffolds and smart fabrics at TUL, heterogeneous catalysts at UT-Lodz, and novel electrochemical sensors at Aalto. Students will have broad options to immerse in quickly evolving research ecosystem at foreign sites that stimulates breakthroughs and discoveries, as well as multiple opportunities to develop passion for exploration and innovation, and courage to influence and excel. Through the team and individual research projects, professional and soft skills-building exercises, this IRES will: (i) advance the theory and practice of ACES, (ii) help to design a better equipment for sizeable production of nanofiber materials and structures, (iii) develop new nanofiber-based materials and structures with desired properties and performance in controlled and predictable manner, and (iv) foster the training of  globally-engaged experts, visionaries, leaders, and team builders for the fast-growing nanofibers research and manufacturing domain, and for the relevant fields.&lt;br/&gt;IRES trainees will regularly reach out to the public, other college and school kids, e.g., through a new annual IRES student-led Nanomaterials Workshop at TUL, research immersion high school workshop at UAB, and broadcasts by JagTV, USA's student-run TV station. All participants will mutually benefit through a growing network of advanced research and training facilities. This project will enable, in a long-term perspective, a broader synergistic coupling between domestic and international research groups by bringing new collaborators and catalyzing the continuation of international student exchanges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
