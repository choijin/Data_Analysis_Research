<AbstractNarration>Universities across the United States play a crucial role in preparing the nation's future generations for success and working to achieve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) goals at regional, state, and national levels. Throughout the workforce, geoscientists are in demand, however a shortage of 135,000 geoscientists has been predicted by 2022. This collaborative project will establish a career-training program which will prepare students for the workforce. This will be achieved through partnerships with professionals throughout academia, government, and industry during which students will gain insight into potential careers post-graduation, and student-led research projects where students will be provided with opportunities to develop and enhance their transferrable skill set. This program has therefore been purposefully designed to facilitate the efficient and effective training the next generation of scientists who will enter the workforce. The program has been designed to systematically recruit 16 students each year across two college campuses (Miami University Oxford and Miami University Hamilton). Enrolled students will have the opportunity to undertake a research project of their own design at a field site. Each student will also have the opportunity to present their own work to the local, regional, national, and international communities both in person and virtually. As students progress through the program a peer-to-peer and student-faculty mentorship program will be established which will also work to foster student motivation, encourage critical thinking, and develop communication skills. Results from this program will be disseminated to the community through presentations and publications throughout the duration of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEOPATHS:EXTRA Advancing Undergraduate Geosciences through Integrated Training Experiences (GP-AUGITE) project will take place on the campus at Miami University, Oxford, OH (main campus, MUO) and Miami University, Hamilton, OH (regional campus, MUH) with a field site in Tonopah, NV. This training-focused, student-centered program has been developed in order to enhance the undergraduate geoscience experience and promote career-readiness. Through a set of evidence-based approaches this program will integrate experiential learning, relevant disciplinary research, scientific communication, and professional development through certification, into the undergraduate curriculum. The program will be internally evaluated through proven metrics of self-assessment, and externally evaluated through a collaboration with the University of Cincinnati Evaluation Services Center. This program will foster an exciting, dynamic learning environment by systematically recruiting traditional and traditionally underrepresented undergraduate students in the STEM fields. The integrative approach aligns to the teacher-scholar model and demonstrates a strong commitment to the training of a STEM-literate population, and a career-ready geoscience workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
