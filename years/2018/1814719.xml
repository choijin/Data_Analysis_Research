<AbstractNarration>This project supports the operation of two astronomical cameras at the Las Campanas Observatory in the Andes Mountains of Chile:  the Parallel Imager for Southern Cosmology Observations (PISCO) and the Southern MicroObservatory.  PISCO is a professional astronomical camera mounted on the 6.5 meter Clay Telescope.  PISCO has a novel design that allows it to take pictures in four different colors at the same time with four large CCD detectors over a piece of the sky about 1/10th the size of the moon.  While the unique design of PISCO has made it useful for many astronomical discoveries, the principal project for which PISCO was built is follow-up of clusters of galaxies discovered by the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The SPT is the most sensitive and highest-resolution telescope in the world for observing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation that arises in the early Universe.   Because the space between galaxies in clusters is filled with hot plasma gas, galaxy clusters appear as a dark spots in front of the CMB.  This is called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.  Among the discoveries by the SPT so far are 530 galaxy clusters, and with a newly-installed highly-sensitive detector called SPT-3G, it will discover thousands more.  When the SPT discovers a galaxy cluster, all that is known about it is its location and the size of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich spot, so follow-up observations by an optical telescope are needed.  Some of those galaxy clusters will appear in existing optical sky surveys, but others will be too faint to appear or will be outside the survey area -- those galaxy clusters will be followed-up by PISCO in this project.  The number and distribution of galaxy clusters provides information about the nature and history of Dark Energy, the mysterious force that dominates the Universe.  Furthermore, PISCO may contribute to improving our knowledge of the mass of neutrinos via "weak lensing" measurements of the mass of the clusters. The determination of the mass of neutrino species has been identified as an important next step in particle physics, an advance that may have wide-reaching impacts on physics and technology, including nuclear physics here on Earth.  The Southern MicroObservatory will be part of a network of automated telescopes that can be controlled over the Internet (mo-www.cfa.harvard.edu). The telescopes are designed to enable youth nationwide to investigate the wonders of the deep sky from their classrooms or after-school centers.  This project will support the installation of a robotic MicroObservatory telescope at Las Campanas and integrate it with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Science Education Department Robotic Telescope Network for the online STEM learning community. The maintenance effort will be efficiently shared with PISCO operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The South Pole Telescope consortium has completed the SPT-SZ and SPTPOL surveys and is now engaged in the SPT-3G deep millimeter-wave continuum survey that will detect thousands of previously-unknown galaxy clusters and groups through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. PISCO observations will play a key role in the production of a mass-limited redshift-independent catalog of galaxy clusters over ~9% of the sky. This searchable public database will include imaging as well as spectroscopy in the optical, infrared, and X-ray, enabling a wide variety of scientific studies. In this project, the SPT consortium will conduct multi-wavelength follow-up of the new SPT-3G survey in order to complete the SPT Cluster Legacy Archive.  This three-year program will produce photometric and spectroscopic catalogs of volume complete samples of galaxy clusters over a 4000 square degree area of sky. After analyzing candidate cluster positions in existing survey data such as DES and VISTA, the SPT team will: (1) make the additional photometric imaging observations needed for completeness in redshift and mass limit, (2) obtain weak lensing measurements during periods of excellent seeing for a representative (albeit still large) subsample of these clusters, (3) make these evolving data sets promptly available to the astronomical and STEM learning communities in both raw and reduced form, through publications and a web-accessible, searchable archive, and (4) analyze the data for cosmology and the determination of neutrino properties.  The formation of clusters and groups of galaxies is a battle between the gravitational attraction of Dark Matter, the dynamics of relativistic and non-relativistic particles, and the repulsive effect of Dark Energy. Their abundance over cosmic time is a sensitive probe of cosmology that complements and refines other cosmological tests. The redshift-independent archive of ~ 8000 confirmed clusters in this project will be the foundation for profound enhancements in our understanding of (a) fundamental properties of the Universe, including greatly improved constraints on the mass and number of neutrino species and the nature and history of Dark Energy out to z ~ 2, and (b) the astrophysics of galaxy clusters and their intracluster medium, the evolution of galaxies and their constituent stellar populations in high-density environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
