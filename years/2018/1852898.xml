<AbstractNarration>With support from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Capacity Building project aims to help address a national shortage of K-12 STEM teachers by strengthening STEM teacher education pathways in Kentucky. This project will enable Bellarmine University to streamline the institution's Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program so that STEM undergraduate students can complete it with only one additional year of study.  The University also intends to develop partnerships with nearby community colleges to facilitate transfer of community college students to the University and their successful completion of both a STEM bachelor's degree and a MAT degree. By streamlining the teacher certification program and developing partnerships to increase access to the institution's MAT program, this project has the potential to increase the number of highly-qualified STEM teachers in high-need K-12 STEM classrooms in Kentucky.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project involves collaborations between Bellarmine University, Bluegrass Community and Technical College, Jefferson Community and Technical College, Jefferson County Public Schools, which is one of the nation's largest urban school districts, and the Kentucky Science Center.  The project aims to accomplish the following goals: (1) develop an early-start MAT certification for STEM undergraduates; (2) develop a recruitment pipeline and support system throughout Bellarmine University's STEM teacher education program via partnership agreements with the collaborating community colleges and school district; (3) develop a partnership agreement with the school district to hire future STEM teachers produced by a subsequent project;  (4) develop a STEM summer camp and internship agreement with the Kentucky Science Center for STEM undergraduates and MAT students; and (5) develop a plan to recruit, prepare, and support new STEM teachers in high-need school districts, thus expanding and diversifying the pool of new STEM teacher candidates. This project comes at a critical time in Kentucky because of changing student demographics, critical industry needs in STEM, and the state's adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards, which have a strong K-12 STEM curriculum. In addition to benefitting a high-need school district in Kentucky, this project is expected to contribute to national efforts in STEM teacher education and serve as a model for other states with similar needs in STEM education.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers.  It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>To address the critical shortage of certified middle and high school STEM teachers in the local high-need schools, this Noyce Capacity Building project at Bellarmine University involved the development of strategic collaborations with Jefferson Community and Technical College, Bluegrass Community and Technical College, Jefferson County Public School district, STEM Academies of Louisville, University of Kentucky, and the Kentucky Science Center. Pipelines developed with these stakeholders will strengthen STEM teacher education pathways in Kentucky by streamlining a high school to career pathway for middle and high school teachers. Several entry points to that pathway have been created and include targeted recruitment through the high school STEM Academies, 2x2 pathways through the community college system, and internship programs for current Bellarmine STEM students. All of these pathways route students to the newly created Early Entry Master of Arts in Teaching programs in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Mathematics. This project comes at a critical time in Kentucky due to the changing student demographics, priority need for science and mathematics teachers, and the state's robust focus on K-12 curricular and assessment reform aligned with the <em>Next Generation Science Standards</em>.</p> <p>This project enabled the development and implementation of the Early Entry Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree program so that undergraduate STEM students can obtain a teacher certification by the end of their post-baccalaureate year after obtaining their STEM bachelor's degree. These Early Entry MAT degree programs have been approved and supported by coordinated institutional efforts in advising and promotion. Early Entry MAT marketing/recruitment and advising materials have been developed for prospective high school, community college, and Bellarmine STEM students. Regarding community college students, a formal recruitment and course transfer pipeline agreement called "2BU" between Bellarmine University and Jefferson Community and Technical College (JCTC), a campus of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS), was established in the STEM fields, whereby students who earn an Associate's degree can transfer to Bellarmine at a 50% reduced tuition expense and embedded wrap around student support services to earn their bachelor's degree in two years and their MAT certification degree in their third year. This is Bellarmine's first formal transfer partnership with a community college.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>To inspire undergraduate STEM students to consider a career in K-12 teaching, a summer internship was created with the Kentucky Science Center (KSC). In 2019, ten STEM students took part in a one-month STEM summer internship&nbsp;to design and implement inquiry-based STEM activities with students from the various grade levels to develop their teaching and classroom management skills. Noyce interns were given a choice of STEM content focus areas and grade levels. In order to diversify their internship, the interns participated in at least three summer camp sessions focused on a variety of science concepts and inquiries. Under the guidance of a summer camp supervisor, interns used problem-based learning focused on the science and engineering practices of the <em>Next Generation Science Standards</em>. Summer camp supervisors conducted quantitative and qualitative evaluations, and an assessment of interns? facilitation, interpersonal,&nbsp; communication/interaction skills. Observational data were analyzed to determine each intern's performance and interaction with the younger students, and to gauge how well they would do as a STEM teacher. Based on the cumulative mean ratings, 100% of the interns met the expectations, while 80% exceeded expectations of KSC staff. In order to determine if interns' would be interested in pursuing a career as a K-12 STEM teacher, a post-internship survey was conducted, and the interns were interviewed to discuss their internship activities and share their views about their internship experience and the impact it had on their perception of K-12 STEM teaching. The internship was a positive experience for the STEM students, and it increased the interest of several students in the teaching profession, with two of the ten students indicating and initiating plans for pursuing education.</p> <p>Project's work resulted in nine presentations disseminated as follows: documentary video about the project was presented at the 2021 STEM for ALL Video Showcase and at the 9th Annual STEM Expo Conference hosted by the National Science Teachers Association; presentations made by PIs and external partners were held at the 2019 and 2021 Midwest Noyce Regional Conference and at the 2020 NSF Noyce Summit. A Noyce intern presented a poster about their summer internship experience at the 2019 Midwest Noyce Regional Conference, and another intern presented a poster at the 2019 Kentucky Academy of Science Meeting. Documentary videos about the Noyce Capacity Building Project, and the about the Noyce Internship at the Kentucky Science Center are available on YouTube and our project webpage.&nbsp; A paper titled "<em>Impact of internship on undergraduate STEM students? interest in STEM teaching"</em>&nbsp;has been submitted for publication to the <em>Electronic Journal for Research in Science &amp;
