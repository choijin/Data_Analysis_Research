<AbstractNarration>In this EAGER project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor James P. Donahue of the Department of Chemistry at Tulane University, is developing the synthesis of metallodithiolene coordination complexes for their application as molecule-based qubits. These molecules support stable electron spins in the form of ligand-radicals that are weakly coupled through space.  They provide a viable platform for quantum computing, which promises to provide a basis for computing on a scale and speed vastly greater than that offered by conventional digital computing. The project provides great opportunities for training of students in synthetic organic and coordination chemistry and for the teaching of physical methods of characterization.  It also helps to develop a workforce on quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metallodithiolene coordination complexes support reversible oxidation of the terminal dithiolene ligands from ene-1,2-dithiolates to stable radical monoanions which weakly couple and thus meet the fundamental criterion for a 2-qubit system. This same general behavior is anticipated for their larger analogs but with the key difference that the central metal center is chosen to provide some mechanism for switching reversibly to a spin active state that, in conjunction with unpaired electrons on the dithiolene radicals, can create a new quantum entangled state with coherence lifetimes that can be measured by electron paramagnetic resonance methods.  The switching mechanism for the metal center may be photoexcitation, thermally-induced spin crossover, or redox chemistry.   The key goal of the project is to create coherent and regenerable quantum states in these molecules with long lifetimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The objective of this research project has been the development of a molecule-based platform for quantum computing. The power and speed promised by quantum computing arises from the multiplicity of states that is inherent to quantum systems. A broad variety of physical systems - ranging from nitrogen vacancies in diamond to silicon quantum dots - are under active investigation as qubits, the fundamental entity that supports quantum computing and data storage. Each system suffers disadvantages - obstacles such as cost, technical challenges with information fidelity, <em>etc</em>. The strategic economic and security ramifications that will attend a leading role in quantum computing justify the parallel pursuit of these different platforms.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This funded project has focused on the creation of molecules that support chemically stable electron spins in the form of dithiolene ligand radical monoanions. A dithiolene ligand is an organo-sulfur chelating ligand that can bind to metal ions and, while thus bound, undergo reversible electron transfer between a fully reduced dithiolate state ((<strong>a</strong>, <strong>Scheme 1</strong>) and a radical monoanion with delocalized unpaired electron ((<strong>b</strong>, <strong>Scheme 1</strong>). If devised in such a way that its dithiolene ligands can interact only weakly as radical monoanions via dipolar coupling (<em>i.e.</em>, via "through-space" interaction), a metallodithiolene coordination complex is a good candidate to serve as scaffold for quantum computing.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The specific platform implemented in this study has used 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(diphenylphosphino)benzene (tpbz) as a rigid, insulating bridge between redox-active metallodithiolene groups (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). We have studied, for example, di-nickel and di-palladium complexes of the form illustrated in <strong>Figure 1</strong> and find that when the complexes are placed in the dicationic state, in which each of the terminal dithiolene ligands is a radical monoanion, the dipolar coupling is slight (<em>D</em> = -15 x 10<sup>-4</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> for M = Pd<sup>2+</sup>). Such weak coupling is an essential feature to a qubit because strong coupling between the electron spins would allow rapid decoherence from any coherent state into which they would be placed and which would form the basis for a logic operation. When probed by EPR Hahn echo decay measurements, dicationic [((MeO-<em>p</em>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>S<sup>?</sup>S<sup>&#8210;</sup>)Ni(tpbz)Ni(S<sup>&#8210;</sup>S<sup>?</sup>C<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-<em>p</em>-OMe)<sub>2</sub>)]<sup>2+</sup> (wherein the closed shell ene-1,2-dithiolate dianions have been oxidized to radical monoanions, ((<strong>b</strong>), <strong>Scheme 1</strong>)) revealed a phase memory time <em>T</em><sub>M</sub> of 3.39(4) &mu;s (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). This <em>T</em><sub>M</sub> is among the best that has been reported thus far for a molecular bipartite construct.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;An advantage to the use of molecules as qubit platform is the flexibility and power for optimization of a desired property by chemical synthesis. Thus, in this funded project, we have expanded several thrusts of effort with the aims of maximizing lifetime of a coherent quantum state and of devising "on-off" control to that state. Pertinent to this second objective, we have developed methods whereby we can create "open-ended" metallodithiolene complexes of the type illustrated as (<strong>a</strong>) in <strong>Figure 3</strong>. Such open-ended tetra-phosphine complexes may then be joined together using some metal ion which, if it has unpaired electrons itself, may mediate distant interaction between the terminal dithiolene radicals if the system is placed into an initial coherent state. We imagine using either photoexcitation of the central ion to create a transient triplet state that could be continuously regenerated or thermally-controlled spin crossover (<em>e.g.</em>, if Fe<sup>2+</sup> is the central ion) as switching mechanisms for the "on-off" creation of a multibit state. In this funding cycle, we have focused upon synthetic methodology and have proven the creation of the molecules shown in <strong>Figure 3</strong> (central ions are [Re(CO)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>1+</sup>, Pt<sup>2+</sup>, Au<sup>1+</sup>) by attaining high-resolution crystal structures. Other trimetallic molecules prepared under this award have spectroscopic evidence supporting their formulation but still require improved purification and/or optimization of their synthesis.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Another effort thrust supported by this award has been an exploration of bridging ligands other than tpbz as connectors between redox active metallodithiolene groups. The specific nature of this bridging ligand has effect on the coherence lifetime of the entangled quantum state that is under study. Two such ligands that have been used to make dimetallic complexes are tetrakis-1,2,4,5-(bis(3,5-dimethylphenyl)phosphino)benzene (Me<sub>16</sub>tpbz) and 1,2,4,5-tetra(isopropylthio)benzene (tibz) (<strong>Figure 4</strong>).</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In summary, metallodithiolene coordination complexes have many desirable properties that continue to make them relevant in quantum computing research: <strong>1</strong>) Their properties (<em>e.g.</em>, redox potentials, solubility) are readily tuned by synthetic modification; <strong>2</strong>) They can be prepared with minimization of the presence of spin-decohering isotopes; <strong>3</strong>) They are chemically stable; <strong>4</strong>) They are made from inexpensive precursors and are therefore not cost prohibitive if synthesis is scaled; <strong>5</strong>) They are amenable to "on-off" control mechanisms, such as spin state crossover in a central ion, which offers greater dimensionality to qubit conceptualization.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/22/2020<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;P&nbsp;Donahue</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836569/1836569_10557148_1608592877841_Scheme1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836569/1836569_10557148_1608592877841_Scheme1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Scheme 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1836569/1836569_10557148_1608592877841_Scheme1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Scheme 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Redox levels available to a dithiolene ligand.
