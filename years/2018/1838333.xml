<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to provide partial travel support for 50 graduate and undergraduate students to attend the premier American Society of Mechanical Engineers event, the International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition to be held on November 9-15, 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The students will participate in a poster symposium to present their research projects to the broader mechanical engineering community. The students will be from a pool of candidates that are being funded through the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) or Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs at the National Science Foundation. The students will be selected based on an application that will include a brief resume, a one-page statement of why they want to attend the conference, and a statement of support from their faculty advisor. Consideration in the selection process will be given to include members of underrepresented groups and diversity of institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This participation support is expected to benefit students' professional, scientific and technical development as they present their NSF funded research projects to the broader mechanical engineering community. Attendance at the conference will provide the students an opportunity to learn about the engineering profession and state-of-the-art research via access to approximately 2000 technical and professional development talks by domestic and international speakers. Students will enhance their communication skills through discussions of their work with the top researchers in their fields during the society-wide poster symposium. They will also have the opportunity to attend technical presentations spanning more than 240 topics, join the keynote and plenary sessions featuring technological pioneers, and network with potential mentors, colleagues, and employers. This interactive experience is expected to broaden their education, increase enthusiasm for their research topic, acquaint them with expectations for scientific careers, and expose them to new avenues for innovative research. This award will benefit the nation through the education of a skilled and diverse engineering workforce better prepared to provide transformative solutions to overcome the challenges of their chosen fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
