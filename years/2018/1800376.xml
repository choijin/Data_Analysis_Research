<AbstractNarration>Some energy conversion and storage technologies use chemical reactions driven by electricity in a process known as electrocatalysis. Examples of these technologies include new metal-air batteries, water splitting for hydrogen evolution, and production of chemicals from the carbon dioxide (the byproduct of burning fossil fuels). All of these technologies share a crucial chemical reaction known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).  The efficiencies of these technologies are often limited by the sluggish rate of the OER. In this project, Dr. Bruce E. Koel of Princeton University is conducting experiments on iridium (Ir) and cobalt (Co) based mixed oxide materials to develop a greater fundamental understanding of the OER.  This project may lead to the discovery of novel electrocatalytic materials to enhance OER. Dr. Koel's research prepares students for careers in high-tech and emerging industries that value the ability to solve complex problems and that utilize sophisticated instrumentation. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students are involved in the research and work together to conduct experiments, construct theoretical models, provide physical insight, and develop new explanations. The importance of this research for addressing the energy needs of the planet enhances student awareness of the impact of their work on society. This research prepares students for careers in academia, national laboratories, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry and Catalysis and Biocatalysis Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environment and Transport Systems, Dr. Koel is conducting experiments on Ir and Co based mixed oxide electrocatalysts that are providing a greater fundamental understanding of OER electrocatalysis. Establishing clear relationships between atomic level surface properties and performance of active electrodes provides a better understanding of electrocatalysts for OER and provides rational strategies for improving OER kinetics. Active structures/motifs are identified during OER by operando Raman spectroscopy and key aspects of the water oxidation mechanism are revealed by identification of surface species during OER by operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy along with fundamental surface science experiments. Iridium based oxide catalysts are studied with the prospect of forming superior OER catalysts.  The researcher also seek to reduce the loading of the expensive Ir metal and provide new materials for the development of cost-effective, high performance, stable OER catalysts. Cobalt based oxide catalysts are investigated because of their OER performance under alkaline conditions.  They have potential for increasing catalyst activity and possibly lowering the pH range of operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
