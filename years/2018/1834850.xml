<AbstractNarration>Raymond Hunter will work alongside colleagues in Peru to study the development of commercialized economies by interrogating labor relations under colonialism. While there have been many previous studies of the development of colonial economic systems, prior research has given less attention to the creative role of agrarian workers in developing economic systems. This project will provide an alternative perspective by clarifying how the decisions of agricultural workers impact the structure of emerging economies. These processes play out over long periods of time - frequently over centuries. Archaeology is ideal to understand changes that emerge over extended periods of time, and further, can provide important insight on the actions of populations that may not be recorded in archives. The project contributes to anthropological theory by developing a conceptual framework to evaluate agrarian labor regimes under colonialism. In doing so, the project engages with an emerging body of anthropological and archaeological literature that explores how global systems are created and shaped by non-elite actors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will examine how the agrarian laborers ultimately responsible for agricultural production engaged with the emerging markets through which the product of their labor was dispersed. The work will be conducted in the Cusco region of Peru, a critical nexus of agricultural production and economic development during the Andean Colonial Period (1532-1824 A.D). In Cusco, large quantities of agricultural goods were produced to supply markets in burgeoning mining towns. This production involved newly introduced products and foreign forms of labor organization that were central to the emergence of the colonial economy. The research team will employ a variety of archaeological methods to clarify how agrarian workers negotiated these shifting conditions over the course of the Colonial Period. By combining data from excavations with extant data from a lake core the research will assess shifting patterns of land use, environmental change, production, and consumption during this period of transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Raymond Hunter completed research for his dissertation over the course of 12 months of fieldwork in Cusco, Peru, during the project funding period. During this time, Hunter was based primarily around the community of Ollantaytambo. Hunter’s research investigated change over time in colonial agriculture in order to understand the impacts of Spanish Colonialism in the Americas. To this end, Hunter directed archaeological investigations at sites occupied during the Inca and Colonial Periods in order to generate comparative datasets.   In order to accomplish the goals of this project Hunter directed excavations at the archaeological site of Simapuqio, located just outside of Ollantaytambo. Hunter and his research team worked with local farmers to complete extensive excavations at Simapuqio, and thereby created a dataset that allowed for a consideration of how agrarian workers during the Colonial Period altered their practice in response to the commercialization of the Andean economy during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The evidence generated through this work include zooarchaeological, botanical, and ceramic data.   These data form the backbone of the argument Hunter is developing in his dissertation. The data demonstrate that as the agricultural economy in the Colonial Andes commercialized, agrarian laborer on large estates became more differentiated from local communities. These data suggest that, paradoxically, as the agricultural sector became more commercial, agricultural workers withdrew from market exchange and depended on local production for food.   Hunter’s research in Peru forms the basis of his dissertation. To be completed in 2021, this dissertation will contribute to the field of archaeology by showing how agricultural systems develop under the environmental and political pressures of colonial encounters.      This research was conducted with collaborations from Peruvian colleagues, students from US universities in Illinois and Tennessee, and students from Cusco, Peru. Over the course of the project, two graduate students from the United States received training in archaeological excavations. An additional four undergraduate students from Cusco were trained the analysis of archaeological materials.          Last Modified: 09/28/2020       Submitted by: Raymond Hunter]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
