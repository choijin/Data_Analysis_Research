<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Meeting the design requirements of the next generation of high performance transportation and energy systems requires the discovery and development of new metallic materials with optimal combinations of properties. Historically, the development of metallic alloys has focused on modifying alloys with one dominant element, such as aluminum or titanium, by adding small percentages of other elements. This strategy neglects the vast design space represented by alloys consisting of several elements in roughly equal fractions. Because many millions of combinations exist within this design space, identifying specific compositions of interest using conventional trial-and-error approaches to alloy development would be very time-consuming and expensive. A rapid and inexpensive method for efficiently screening the possible candidate compositions is required. This project uses computer simulations to identify combinations of elements with the potential for improved properties, and then manufactures only the most promising combinations for further consideration. To further reduce costs, an advanced 3D printing-based synthesis method is used to construct compact material libraries consisting of approximately 100 distinct compositions. The alloy library construction is accomplished in minutes, using only a few grams of material. The libraries are screened to identify the specific compositions with the best combinations of strength, density, cost, or other properties. This 'high-throughput' approach to metal alloy design will dramatically increase efficiency and reduce the cost required to discover and optimize new high performance metallic materials. Furthermore, the project will contribute to development of a science and engineering workforce trained in computational and efficient manufacturing methods, as well as impact K-12 science and engineering education through workshops targeting middle and high school teachers from diverse school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Meeting the design requirements of the next generation of high performance transportation systems, power generators, and energy storage devices requires the discovery and development of new structural alloys with enhanced properties. Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), consisting of several constituent elements but no dominant solvent species, represent a vast yet under-explored design space due to the time-consuming nature of traditional alloy design methods. The objective of this collaborative project is to investigate the role of chemical composition on the phase-stability and mechanical properties of MPEAs having a dominant BCC phase using a high-throughput approach. The project integrates first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and state-of-the-art laser deposition-based synthesis to rapidly discover MPEAs with desirable combinations of strength, density, melting temperature, and cost. The local structure is characterized using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope imaging and spectroscopy, which are combined with DFT calculations to elucidate the roles of configurational entropy, mixing enthalpy, lattice strains and other factors on phase stability. Variations in the mechanical properties with composition are characterized using nanoindentation and other micromechanical methods and correlated with the structure in order to develop appropriate structure-property models. Alloys with the most promising microscale properties will be prepared in bulk for further analysis and model validation. By enabling rapid evaluation over the full breadth of the multicomponent design space, the project has the potential to deepen the scientific community's understanding of these complex alloys and identify new materials with vastly improved and unexpected combinations of properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
