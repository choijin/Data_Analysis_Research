<AbstractNarration>Protein molecules are basic components in all forms of life, and electrostatic effects play a key role in &lt;br/&gt;determining protein structure and function. However studying these effects experimentally is difficult, &lt;br/&gt;and there is great interest in using computer simulations to advance this area of biochemical research. &lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute by developing new mathematical algorithms to improve the accuracy and &lt;br/&gt;efficiency of these simulations. Potential biomedical applications include (1) protein-ligand binding, &lt;br/&gt;which is important for synthetic drug design, and (2) protein folding, which is important for &lt;br/&gt;understanding how misfolding causes disease. The investigators will collaborate with bioscientists, and &lt;br/&gt;the software developed in the project will be made available in open source format for use by the &lt;br/&gt;scientific community. The project results will be disseminated through conference and seminar &lt;br/&gt;presentations, and publications in scientific journals. The project will develop the national workforce in &lt;br/&gt;computational mathematics by training junior personnel at the postdoctoral, graduate student, and &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student levels.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Biochemical simulations of charged particle systems are often limited by the cost of computing long-&lt;br/&gt;range electrostatic interactions. To address this issue the PIs have developed a treecode-accelerated &lt;br/&gt;boundary integral (TABI) method to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for the electrostatic &lt;br/&gt;potential of a solvated protein. In this project the PIs will extend the TABI solver to the challenging case &lt;br/&gt;of interacting proteins in solvent, focusing on subtle dielectric and ionic structural effects. The work &lt;br/&gt;entails advances in modeling, improvements in treecode and boundary element methods, and &lt;br/&gt;applications in molecular biochemistry including the following topics: (1) The TABI code will be &lt;br/&gt;extended to compute the binding energy of a solvated protein-protein complex. (2) The treecode will &lt;br/&gt;be adapted to accelerate computations of the total correlation function in the Reference Interaction &lt;br/&gt;Site Model (RISM) which provides a physically accurate description of the water structure near the &lt;br/&gt;solute/solvent interface. (3) Explicit ion simulations will be carried out to validate the PB and RISM &lt;br/&gt;simulations, and to investigate the effect of finite ion size on the interfacial charge structure. (4) The &lt;br/&gt;treecode will be improved by implementing a more effective multipole acceptance criterion, and &lt;br/&gt;parallel CPU and GPU implementations of the treecode will be developed. (5) A new method for &lt;br/&gt;computing electrostatic PB forces will be tested for application in molecular dynamics simulations of &lt;br/&gt;interacting proteins in solvent. (6) Efficient computation of pH-dependent effects in solvated proteins &lt;br/&gt;will be demonstrated using TABI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
