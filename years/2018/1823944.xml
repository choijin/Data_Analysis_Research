<AbstractNarration>This project examines how to increase tolerance and openness to disagreement. It is based on a consideration of the fundamental human motivation to avoid harm. Not only do people avoid harm to themselves, people also think it reasonable for others to avoid harm. It is therefore expected that people will be more tolerant of opposing viewpoints when those viewpoints are seen as being motivated by the avoidance of harm.  Framing social viewpoints in terms of harm avoidance may make those with opposing views seem more rational.  Six studies explore how to increase tolerance using the idea of rationality of harm avoidance.  The long-term goal of the research is to provide a strong foundation to inform efforts aimed at reducing intolerance, and enhancing positive interactions with those with opposing viewpoints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tests whether the fundamental human motivation to avoid harm can be leveraged to increase tolerance. Six studies examine people's willingness to interact with those with different views and their willingness to allow the expression of opposing views. The approach is to harness multiple methods, including laboratory experiments, archival studies, and nationally representative surveys. The experiments will be pre-registered and adhere to best practices of open science. Mediational analyses will test for the predicted pathway from harm avoidance to tolerance via perceived vulnerability and rationality.  The survey and behavioral studies will test other effects of the tolerance produced by the rationality of harm avoidance intervention. By emphasizing the universal human motivation to avoid harm, this project will transform scientific understanding of tolerance, and extend the research literatures on mind perception and intergroup empathy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
