<AbstractNarration>The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is the NSF's most prestigious grant bestowed on outstanding tenure-track faculty members to support their exceptional research and educational activities. This grant supports organization of the next three CISE CAREER Proposal Writing Workshops at NSF headquarters and nearby conference facilities for workshop venue, in spring 2018, 2019, and 2020, in coordination with NSF staff.  Each workshop expects 250-300 junior faculty members from all CAREER-eligible principal investigators in NSF-supported disciplines at U.S. universities and colleges to attend. Preferences will be given to junior faculty in CISE-related disciplines. Several fellowships of travel will be given to junior faculty from HBCU/MEI and under-represented groups, including women, to attend the workshop. The presentations by recent CISE CAREER awardees will be hosted online and the slides and videos will be available on the workshop website for other faculty members who might not be able to attend the workshop in person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one-day workshop will consist of the presentations on the CAREER solicitation and CISE other programs with question and answer (Q&amp;A), talks given by recent CAREER awardees, program director panel presentation and Q&amp;A, as well as program-specific discussions with NSF program managers. The opportunities to interact with NSF program managers will be valuable to junior faculty in developing competitive CAREER proposals. These workshops will help prepare junior faculty in CISE-related disciplines to develop outstanding research and education activities at their universities and write competitive CAREER proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
