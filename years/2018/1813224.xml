<AbstractNarration>The powerful innovation and application of computing in the science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) disciplines has increased the need for real-world, interdisciplinary, and computational preparation of students from the early grades through high school. Such interdisciplinary teaching and learning must be developed with the understanding of the needs and capacity of elementary school teachers and their students, and appropriate grade-specific integration in the elementary curriculum. This exploratory research will study the landscape of K-5 elementary teachers and how they engage students in computational thinking, and apply concepts associated with computing and computational thinking in their teaching of STEM content so implementation efforts are viable. By better understanding how computational thinking concepts and approaches integrate authentically into math, science and other subjects, policymakers and district leaders will be informed of how to intentionally support teachers and students to develop their core skills that will provide a strong foundation for computing applications in STEM teaching and learning. Outcomes of the research will include a better understanding of computational thinking concepts and approaches across the K-5 curriculum to inform future implementation efforts; increased awareness of computational thinking definitions for K-5 teachers so teachers are more prepared to apply computing in their practice; and inform the professional development needs of K-5 teachers. Findings will support computational integration in STEM education in elementary school built on evidence and best practices. This project was submitted to the DRK12-STEM+C DCL (17-149) and is supported by the STEM+C Program that focuses on research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. STEM+C supports research on how students learn to think computationally to solve interdisciplinary problems in the STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a convergent parallel mixed methods design, survey data will be collected concurrently with Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) activity artifacts and merged (1) to provide a holistic picture of how computational thinking (CT) concepts and approaches are currently being addressed in elementary classrooms and (2) to identify how new CT concepts and approaches in computing programs relate to those already applied in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Practitioners will engage in the process of research and will help to steer the exploratory study through a series of value mapping activities. Multiple correlation coefficient (R) and HLM statistical analysis of teacher survey data will explain where and when CT concepts and approaches are present in the current elementary classroom. By including educators and researchers from across the STEM+C fields, as well as including schools from urban, rural, and suburban areas, the project will explore what works and for whom. As the project is concerned with supporting and sustaining systemic change, the project's long-term sustainability goals will benefit from the infrastructure developed through an NSF Local Systemic Change grant that has matured over the past 20 years. The relationships between the University and 12 local school districts, as well as mechanisms for communication will be a key factor in the sustainability of the project. The research and activities will result in the dissemination of a multimedia model for interdisciplinary computing. The model will inform further research on the development and implementation of teaching computing as an integral, embedded component of STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
