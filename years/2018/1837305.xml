<AbstractNarration>Rutgers University proposes a research practice partnership (RPP) -- the Computer Science Teaching and Learning Collaboratory (CS-TLC) -- that brings together computer science (CS) educators, educational researchers, and industry partners to provide targeted, differentiated professional development (PD) and ongoing virtual support to high school CS teachers and schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, CS-TLC will (a) develop and deliver high-quality CS PD for teachers that enhances their ability to deliver instruction that is responsive to their students' abilities, motivation, and cultural backgrounds; (b) invest in building the capacity of school and district leaders to plan, implement, manage, and evaluate programs and policies that can support rigor and equity in CS education; and (c) engage in research and community-building activities that can improve the performance, effectiveness, and sustainability of the RPP as well as expand the size and diversity of its membership. This proposal directly addresses the issue of equity in CS education as the collaborating school districts serve many students who have been traditionally underrepresented in CS including rural students, students living in poverty, and Hispanic and African American students. By working in collaboration with a network of teachers and administrators who serve these students, the team well tailor activities and pedagogy of content to addresses the different needs and experiences of students, providing them with opportunities for rigorous and engaging CS instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
