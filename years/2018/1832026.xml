<AbstractNarration>Oxygen, in combination with other molecules, generates energy that powers many biochemical processes. Without oxygen, humans could not exist. However, in the process of generating energy by "burning" nutrients with oxygen, certain "rogue" oxygen molecules, known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), are created as inevitable byproducts. One of the body's most powerful natural antioxidant enzymes is superoxide dismutase (SOD), which is responsible for disarming the most dangerous free radicals of all: the highly reactive superoxide radicals.  All human cells produce superoxide dismutase to neutralize these superoxide radicals. It has been shown consistently that muscle activity leads to a strong increase in ROS production due to increased oxygen consumption.  The investigator will test the hypothesis that a muscle specific protein, called Myocyte Enhancing Factor-2 (MEF-2), regulates SOD expression in the muscle tissue.   Using a variety of molecular and cell biological procedures, the mechanistic link between MEF2 and SOD in muscle tissue will be evaluated.  The project will provide state of the art technical skills to many undergraduate students who will be involved in many parts of the experiments.   Howard University, a culturally diverse, research-intensive Historically Black College and University (HBCU) has approximately 97% of enrollees who are African Americans, therefore, the project will provide rich training opportunities for underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muscle function depends on high-level oxygen consumption and the concomitant high-level flux of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated as by-products of oxygen metabolism. Manganese superoxide dismutase (or SOD2) is engaged in the mitochondrial defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Loss of SOD2 function causes neonatal lethality. SOD2 function is more critical in muscles than in other tissues, which is consistent with the high level of oxygen consumption and prolific ROS generation by muscle mitochondria.  So, unfettered ROS production is a mitochondrial hazard. As a transcription factor, Myocyte Enhancing Factor-2 (MEF-2) plays a critical role in the specification and subsequent differentiation of all muscle types. MEF-2 continues to be expressed in adult muscles with no other function attributed to MEF-2 in adult insects. In Drosophila, SOD2 expression is dependent on the presence of MEF-2 transcription factor.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MEF-2 plays a novel, continuing role in adult muscle physiology by modulating mitochondrial stress response through SOD2. The three specific objectives are to determine: 1) the mechanistic connection between MEF-2 and SOD2 in adult muscle, 2) the influence of the MEF-2/SOD2 interaction on oxidative stress response and mitochondrial integrity, and 3) the broad biological significance of the MEF-2/SOD2 interaction on muscle biology at the whole organism level. The proposed study will contribute to the understanding of oxidative damage in muscle specifically in context to the biology of mitochondria. Research training opportunities will be provided to many underrepresented minority undergraduate and graduate students, who will acquire new skills with basic and translational applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
