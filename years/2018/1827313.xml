<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Kraig Wheeler from Whitworth University and colleagues Jamie Manson from Eastern Washington University, Matthew E Cremeens from Gonzaga University and Travis Denton from Eastern Washington University have acquired a single crystal diffractometer. An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule.  This includes bond distances and angles.  This provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules.  The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry.  In one project, the research targets molecules that may serve as quantum magnets.  In a green chemistry approach, catalysts containing iron are being synthesized that can replace other less expensive metals.  Chalcones, materials with biological activity beneficial for anti-inflammation, are being studied.  The diffractometer is used in a collaborative network to train and to provide undergraduate and graduate students with the principles of crystallography.  The following institutions are the main members of the network:  Whitworth University, Gonzaga University, Eastern Illinois University, Oakland University, Knox College, Eastern Washington University, and Washington State University. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies of molecular recognition profiles of quasiracemic materials. Medicinal-relevant chalcones are being investigated as well as the design of small organic molecules as possible pharmaceutical chaperones. The diffractometer is used in structure analyses of iron catalysts supported by alpha-diimine ligands.  This instrument also serves projects developing near-infrared active materials.  It is used in research to design small molecule inhibitors of cytochrome 450 2A6 that have potential for use in stopping smoking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
