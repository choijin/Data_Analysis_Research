<AbstractNarration>Carbohydrates are among nature's most abundant biomolecules, with roles ranging from structural biopolymers to a multitude of cellular processes.  Biomass is a potential source of renewable energy and a source of value-added small molecule products, but requires molecular catalysts capable of efficiently degrading these materials in ways that are more energy efficient and environmentally friendly.  Such catalysts (glycosidases) have broad application in the pharmaceutical and food technology industries, as well as in the production of valuable fuel products. Dr. Cowan's research program provides training in a diverse and multidisciplinary array of experimental tools and techniques in areas of chemical, biological, and physical sciences. While the questions being addressed are primarily curiosity-driven, the research has broader relevance to areas of bimolecular recognition and catalysis. The most significant impact of any research endeavor is the development of intellectual capital that in turn is reinvested in society and the scientific work force of the future. To that end, Dr. Cowan has developed internship and training opportunities with local biotech businesses, and personally mentors K-12 and undergraduate trainees.  Dr. Cowan is actively engaged in outreach activities that build upon his research to promote engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities, which include summer research internships in Dr. Cowan's laboratory, are directed at improving the education of promising high school seniors and women students and encouraging their interest in STEM careers, as well outreach to local elementary schools and Cub Scout dens and packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Cowan, of The Ohio State University, is developing artificial glycosidases that promote recognition and selective cleavage of complex oligosaccharides and carbohydrates. This work develops metallopeptides as glycosidase catalysts, and seeks a fundamental understanding of the structural basis for peptide-saccharide recognition that will guide the design of selective sugar-targeting catalysts. By use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a tool to determine structure, and isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance to evaluate binding energetics, Dr. Cowan and his coworkers are elucidating the role of specific amino acids in promoting sugar recognition and binding. Liquid chromatography and a variety of mass spectrometric methods are used to characterize catalyst reactivity, reaction products, and mechanism of action. Dr. Cowan's research program is developing catalysts for selective cleavage of oligo and polysaccharides, both as chemical tools for biochemical study, and for practical application in biomass degradation. His laboratory provides training in a diverse and multidisciplinary array of experimental tools and techniques in areas of chemical, biological, and physical science, including analytical reasoning. While the questions being addressed are primarily curiosity-driven, it is reasonable to expect that a fuller understanding of carbohydrate recognition and efficient catalytic degradation of stable sugar molecules has broader relevance to areas of bimolecular recognition and catalysis. The most significant impact of any research endeavor is the development of intellectual capital that in turn is reinvested in society and the scientific work force of the future. To that end, Dr. Cowan has developed internship and training opportunities with local biotech businesses, and personally mentors K-12 and undergraduate trainees.  Dr. Cowan is actively engaged in outreach activities that build upon his research to promote engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities, which include summer research internships in Dr. Cowan?s laboratory, are directed at improving the education of promising high school seniors and women students and encouraging their interest in STEM careers, as well outreach to local elementary schools and Cub Scout dens and packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
