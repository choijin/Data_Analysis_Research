<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable emergency managers, first responders, and elected officials across the country to increase community resilience in disaster to save countless lives, save key critical infrastructure, and save the environment from otherwise catastrophic outcomes during disasters, some of which continue to increase in frequency and severity.  It will allow for significant advances in protecting our society's most vulnerable populations in disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develop a platform to integrate, interpret, and organize a multitude of relevant data sources in order to deliver actionable insights to those responsible for intervention before, during, and after disaster. This project will enable a fully integrated, dynamic web-based tool capable of generating estimated and real-time results for a broad set of hazards across the nation down to the neighborhood level granularity. As a real-time, dynamic tool, it will operationalize population vulnerability data and provide forward-leaning decision support and actionable intelligence to first responders, emergency managers, and elected officials that will save lives by identifying those populations with the greatest needs and highest risk during a disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The overarching goal of the project was to augment Geospiza’s existing data analytics product with real-time, geographically granular data to provide public safety agencies and risk managers greater insight and operational capacity when engaging in disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. This project sought to facilitate community resilience by making more data available and making that data useful, and was successful at that outcome.  Research indicates that providing additional data and ensuring that all data can be easily accessed and analyzed from a single platform, reduces the administrative burden of data-driven decision making and increases operational efficiency and effectiveness. That said, more data alone does not provide the support that emergency management, public safety, and risk professionals require to make better, more-informed decisions. Instead, the raw data needs to be processed and transformed into information products.  During this project, our team identified more than 550 datasets which provided quality data relevant to our customers, were dynamic (rather than a single point in time), and had a mechanism by which we could easily ingest the data and make it available via our data platform. The data quality, relevance, and integration complexity was score. In total, six datasets were integrated, made available for visualization, and made operational within our modeling framework.   Once the data was integrated into the visualization platform, a series of six, hazard-specific workflows were created to transform the raw into actionable information products. The hazards for which workflows were constructed include air pollution, coastal flooding, drought, extreme heat, river flooding, and wildfire.  Our team used adaptive pathways as the framework for workflow construction. Adaptive pathways are unique and useful in the community resilience use case because, rather than taking different scenarios as a starting point and assessing the impacts of changes and possible measures, the framework analyzes current policies and management strategies and determines when they no longer meet the clearly stated objectives. Once the threshold is reached, an alternative policy or management strategy is required (or a ‘‘tipping point’’ is triggered).  There is currently only a single product available to build adaptation pathways, and it has limited functionality and does not link tipping points and triggers to real-time data. Others are building adaptation pathways in static tools like Microsoft Powerpoint, Vizio, and Tableau. While building the six, hazard-specific adaptive pathways, we also built out the ability for a user within the platform to construct their own adaptive pathway and link the metrics and triggers within the pathway to live data. This is a significant development and addition to public safety and community resilience technology space.  To ensure the data integration and workflow creation were useful and of value, we engaged customers, potential customers, mentors, and colleagues in a multi-phase, structured feedback process.  We achieved the desired 50+ NPS on all work and found qualitative discussion based feedback useful in ensuring the usefulness of the new data feeds, accompanying user interface (UI), and action workflows. Final products created via this project received high marks from emergency management, public safety, and risk professionals who agreed that they would have a positive impact on the work they do to enhance community resilience.
