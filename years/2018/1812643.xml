<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in enabling new location-based services by using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons in several important market verticals such as public transportation, retail, and events management, to name just a few.  BLE beacon-based software solutions can provide low-cost location-based services in both indoor and outdoor locations, supporting, for example, automatic foot traffic counts and location-based product promotions. As an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, BLE beacons have the potential to become the leading proximity technology. However, the pros and cons of using these technologies in different settings are still not fully understood. For instance, privacy issues regarding location sharing in public spaces can impede the adoption of these technologies. This I-Corps project will explore implementation and commercialization opportunities of beacon-based technologies in airports, business conferences, and retail stores. The success of this project can help promote the adoption of this IoT technology and result in improved efficiency in public services and enhanced quality of people's daily lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will identify the commercial potential for using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon technology to provide new and low-cost location-based services. A BLE beacon actively broadcasts Bluetooth signals, which can be received by nearby Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. Thus, mobile applications can leverage the beacons that are installed at different locations to detect people's movements, for instance, sensing when people enter or exit certain locations, and estimating the number of people co-located at certain locations. Effective beacon-based solutions need to address the following: ensure accurate movement detection when different beacons' Bluetooth signals interfere with each other; provide a scalable service where a large number of beacons can be supported by different mobile platforms; and include privacy-preserving features to address people's privacy concerns. This project will lead to a better understanding of varying requirements for beacon-based location services and how they might be customized to potentially service a variety of market verticals.</AbstractNarration>
