<AbstractNarration>The focus of the Sustainable Groundwater Resources REU Site is groundwater sustainability science. Groundwater is a fundamental component of the global hydrologic cycle and a vital natural resource. It sustains many rivers, lakes, wetlands, and other groundwater dependent ecosystems, and is a significant source of freshwater for human consumption. Groundwater is also the foundation for irrigated agroecosystems, food production, ecosystem services, energy-extraction and production, and other industries. As a result of this demand, excessive groundwater (over)extraction, particularly in many of the largest and most important food producing aquifer systems in arid and semi-arid regions, has resulted in rapidly declining water levels and substantial loss of storage, referred to as the global groundwater crisis. Climate variability and change and the associated modifications to the hydrologic cycle are exacerbating concerns over the global groundwater crisis and societal implications. The sustainability of groundwater resources, particularly in California, is a well-recognized and urgent concern from local to global scales. Our students and exceptionally well-qualified Research Mentors will address knowledge gaps and practical solutions to the global groundwater crisis, with particular emphasis on California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). We will also use a formative and summative evaluation plan to rigorously assess and continually improve the quality and impact of our REU Site. The REU Site will have the following positive impacts: (1) help create an engaged U.S. workforce; (2) contribute to the diversification of the U.S. workforce; (3) help prepare students for careers to meet the unprecedented challenges of sustainable freshwater resources, particularly related to SGMA; (4) promote increased research productivity and new research ideas for all participants; and (5) help build academic capacity and practical solutions for rural and urban communities across California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site will provide genuine research experience and training in groundwater sustainability science for undergraduate students, particularly women and underrepresented minorities (URM), at an early stage in their scientific careers. There are five primary objectives. (1) To provide junior- and senior-level undergraduates the opportunity to engage in independent research and make original intellectual contributions. (2) To provide community based research experience and professional development opportunities that create an engaged workforce in hydrologic sciences and engineering. (3) To expand the participation and increase the retention of women and URM students in STEM. (4) To integrate cutting edge research and training about groundwater sustainability science, particularly related to California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). (5) To provide a framework for productive collaboration between interdisciplinary Research Mentors and undergraduates across the CSU system.  The REU Site has five components. (1) A two-week, inquiry-based learning orientation that exposes students to the scientific process and fundamental concepts and skills. (2) A seven-week independent research experience where students will take primary responsibility for their project, while under their RM's guidance and resources. (3) A weekly professional development seminar where students engage with professionals to learn about graduate school and careers. (4) Social and professional activities to foster a strong cohort experience. (5) A community-wide research symposium where REU students will present their research results to the California groundwater community, friends, and family. We will recruit 10 students per year from the diverse URM student talent pool in the 23-campus California State University system and from across the U.S., training a total of 30 REU fellows over the three-year REU Site. We will target women and URM students who have completed at least one year of college-level hydrology or related courses, and interest in pursuing a graduate degree(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
