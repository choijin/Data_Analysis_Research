<AbstractNarration>Fertilization represents a major biological challenge, where sperm and egg must recognize and bind each other to create new life. However, an equally serious challenge soon awaits. Immediately after fertilization, the new embryo must rapidly remodel its surface so that additional sperm can no longer bind, and it must create an impenetrable barrier that will protect the embryo during development. The goal of this project is to explore protective barrier formation in the nematode worm, C. elegans, which offers several advantages over other organisms typically used to study this process (humans, mice, sea urchins). The work will be conducted entirely by undergraduate and high school students at Pomona College, a small liberal arts college dedicated to training the next generation of exceptional scientists. A diverse group of students in the investigator's research lab, as well as students in an Advanced Cell Biology course, will use genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to investigate eggshell assembly in C. elegans. These studies will harness the power of C. elegans as a model system to explore both widely-conserved and species-specific strategies that contribute to protective barrier assembly in nematodes. Common features will lend insight into evolutionarily-conserved reproductive strategies, while species-specific features could identify new therapeutic targets to fight parasitic nematode infection of humans, plants, and animals. Importantly, this award will also create a mentorship pipeline for students historically underrepresented in science to support their persistence in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before fertilization, the C. elegans vitelline layer (analogous to the mammalian zona pellucida, fish chorion, and sea urchin vitelline layer) forms on the oocyte surface and is comprised of at least three proteins with an interdependent relationship. CBD-1 functions at the top of the hierarchy and recruits PERM-2 and PERM-4, who in turn maintain each other's localization. Interestingly, CBD-1 also organizes a separate protein complex involved in fertilization and egg activation (the EGG complex). After fertilization, the PERM complex is remodeled into the outermost eggshell layer, while the EGG complex is internalized. Little is understood about the mechanism of vitelline layer remodeling, or how the relationships among vitelline layer proteins promote these events. In Aim 1 of this project, students will examine the interdependence of the PERM and EGG structural scaffolds at the oocyte surface before fertilization by analyzing null mutants and domain variants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. In Aim 2, students will use biochemical and phenotypic analyses to investigate how PERM-2 and PERM-4 contribute to the structural and functional changes to the vitelline layer after fertilization. In Aim 3, they will explore whether similarities exist between nematode and mammalian vitelline layer structure and assembly. Together, these studies will provide mechanistic insight into conserved and divergent processes in protective barrier assembly across distantly-related phyla.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
