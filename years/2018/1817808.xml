<AbstractNarration>In 1990, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) published the groundbreaking document, "The Liberal Art of Science," which recommended that all college students should take more science courses.  This book and associated program argued that science pervades all aspects of contemporary human existence and that our nation?s future economy and security and the quality of individual lives depend on the public?s understanding of scientific developments.  The importance of science for all remains true today.  Since 1990, however, the science and science education communities have made significant discoveries about how students learn, how to engage a broader spectrum of students in science, what are effective pedagogical methods to teach science, and what scientifically literate citizens and future scientists should know and be able to do.  In 1990, many Americans were noted to have little understanding of science or how it affected their lives, and many students, especially from underrepresented groups, had limited access to or incentives to pursue science as a degree or career.  These major issues still hold true in 2018.  Thus, the revision of ?The Liberal Art of Science? is an important and timely endeavor, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs while addressing continuing problems.  The workshop will bring together scientists and science educators to outline and begin writing an updated ?Liberal Art of Science? and to plan for the widespread implementation of contemporary recommendations for teaching and learning science by improving existing science courses and not simply trying to add more courses to a student?s already crowded curriculum.  Workshop participants will have diverse research interests in science, science education, faculty professional development, and science literacy.  They will also represent major scientific and science education organizations and institutional associations actively engaged in professional development of their members.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants at the workshop will have significant obligations before attending the meeting at the headquarters of the AAAS in Washington, D.C.  Each person will be asked either to draft an outline of a chapter in the new book or prepare a presentation for the workshop itself based on their interests and expertise.  In addition, each person will identify one or two exemplary individuals or programs that use active learning methods, increase scientific literacy of students, or focus on learning outcomes that prepare students for a world that is increasingly influenced by science and technology.  The workshop, which will extend over parts of three days, will be a series of presentations, discussions, and small working groups and will result in an outline of the entire new document and a plan to disseminate and implement new recommendations for change.         &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
