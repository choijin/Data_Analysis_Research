<AbstractNarration>The universe evolved from a simple state where matter was almost uniformly distributed in space. In the present day the matter is very strongly clustered into galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and even larger structures. This evolution is governed by gravity and by additional processes such as formation of stars in galaxies. There is enormous amount of information about the universe origins, content, and future evolution hidden in the galaxy distribution.  This information is difficult to access in the present-day form because it has been scrambled by gravity and other processes. The goal of this project is to use simulations to reconstruct the initial conditions of our universe. When these are evolved in time with known laws of physics, they give rise to our visible universe. Ultimately this will allow a movie to made of our universe starting from the initial smooth distribution and ending in images of actual galaxies such as the Hubble Deep Field. A major benefit of this method is that information about our universe can be simply extracted from the initial conditions.  More broadly, an aim of this project is to impact other communities where similar problems arise such as machine learning via the methods and tools developed   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to develop and apply a new set of theoretical and computational instruments, including new statistical methods, algorithms, and computational implementations, to optimally reconstruct the initial condition of our universe from the spatial distribution of galaxies. Galaxies are a primary probe of the large scale structure of the universe that are or will be observed by surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), EUCLID and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). This project will extend a hierarchical probabilistic generative model developed by the PI's team to the modelling of galaxies. The framework attempts to solve an exact probabilistic model for the initial conditions that is conditioned on the data with a process that combines elements of numerical optimization in high dimensions and analytic marginalization to find the best solution and their covariance matrix. The proposed research will apply this method to galaxy redshift catalogs and their surrounding dark matter information inferred from weak lensing. The method will be developed using realistic simulations of both dark matter and of galaxies populated in the dark matter and hydro simulations, before being applied to real data.  This research will explore best methods to achieve fast convergence in the search for local and global minimum and aims to have an impact more broadly to research areas (e.g. neural networks) outside astronomy in the tools developed for non-convex optimization in very high dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
