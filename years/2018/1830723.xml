<AbstractNarration>The quality of water in lakes changes with increasing temperature and nutrient enrichment that leads to algal blooms. Increases in algal blooms typically include cyanobacteria, which are capable of producing toxins called cyanotoxins. These cyanotoxins are harmful to human health and to other animals that live in or drink water from the lakes. There is little, historical data on algal blooms and cyanotoxins, which makes it difficult to understand how long they have been occurring and what makes them happen. This project will advance our understanding of algal blooms and cyanotoxin occurrence by focusing on the historical record of cyanotoxins that are preserved in the sediments of lakes. There are significant challenges in relating the cyanotoxin in lake sediments to their historic production in the water column of lakes. This EAGER project will develop innovative methods to extract and measure cyanotoxins in lake sediment, and conduct experiments to quantify how the toxins degrade under various environmental conditions. Researchers will then make critical determinations of historic production of these toxins for Lake Harris in Florida. Results from this project will be broadly useful in developing standard methods for the study of cyanotoxins in all lakes and reservoirs, and will provide lake and municipal water managers a new tool to acquire cyanotoxin data on a longer time scale. This project will also provide research training for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including members of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While these paleolimnological investigations are providing much needed records of historic cyanotoxin production, it is unknown if changes in paleo-cyanotoxin stratigraphies result from alterations in toxin production, degradation or deposition. As a result, sediment studies incorporating cyanotoxins as a proxy are at risk to incorrectly infer historic toxin production. This research will establish cyanotoxin water-sediment connections, develop innovative analytical protocols, and cutting-edge degradation indices for determining cyanotoxin sediment studies on cylindrospermopsin and microcystin. In addition, results from these experiments will used to verify cyanotoxin deposition with known periods of historic eutrophication and limnological change throughout the Holocene. The objectives of the study are: 1) develop sediment-water column connections for cyanotoxins by matching surface sediment cyanotoxin concentrations with known water column cyanotoxin values and improving extraction methods, 2) determine degradation coefficients for CYN and MC in a variety of sediment types under a range of environmental variables (temperature, oxygen, organic matter content) experienced in lake sediment environments, and 3) identify stratigraphic changes of cyanotoxins and cyanobacteria pigments from sediment cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Cyanobacteria toxins or cyanotoxins are a group of metabolites produced by cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) that can negatively impact human health, lake recreation, and water treatment facilities.  While many lake monitoring programs have begun to include cyanotoxins, the ecological conditions triggering cyanotoxin production and the occurrence of cyanotoxins prior to monitoring efforts has not been established.  One way to way to provide historic data for lake systems that precedes monitoring efforts is to reconstruct the history of lakes by using the sediment record, called paleolimnology.  However, before cyanotoxin analysis can be incorporated into paleolimnological investigations, a series of experiments needs to be conducted so that cyanotoxin data from the sediments can be interpreted.  The primary objective of this project was to collect sediment samples from a large number of lakes (n=47) and conduct a series of experiments and analyses to establish cyanotoxins as a paleolimnological tool.  Specific objectives were to: 1) identify the distribution and concentration of cyanotoxins in the sediments throughout the 47 lake dataset, 2) determine extraction procedures that maximize cyanotoxin removal from the sediments, 3) identify the characteristics that promote and negate cyanotoxin degradation in the sediments following deposition, 4) use the 47 lake data set of cyanotoxins and other sediment characteristics to identify triggers promoting cyanotoxin production, and 5) apply these techniques to long sediment cores demonstrating the use of cyanotoxin analysis on longer timescales (&gt;1000 years).  The results from these experiments and analyses showed that cyanotoxin deposition throughout study area (Florida, USA) focused in the central region of the state and otherwise did not show any spatial pattern when compared to other variables (Figure 1).  Extraction was determined to be successful following a procedure for soils developed by the Eurofins company with modifications for sediment amounts and types typically collected in sediment studies.  Degradation experiments showed that cyanotoxins resist degradation on the timescales analyzed suggesting a viable use in historic reconstructions.  Through multivariate statistical analysis, the common cyanotoxin, microcystin, was associated with high cyanobacteria abundance and phosphorus levels and with low levels of Fe deposited in the sediments.  While phosphorus is normally measured in monitoring efforts, the link to Fe from this study could provide and new trigger to be investigated by future laboratory experiments.   Finally, the application of these techniques to longer sediment cores collected from Lake Harris, Florida (Figure 2) and Lake Amatitl?n, Guatemala demonstrated the potential application of cyanotoxin analysis in paleolimnological studies spanning the last 3,000 years and beyond.                In addition to the benefits to academic science fields, other applications and benefits did arise from this project.  First, the primary objective was accomplished with a protocol developed for other paleolimnological studies to apply cyanotoxin analysis to other lake systems.  This will allow local stakeholders and managers the ability to determine if cyanotoxins have been reoccurring in lake systems throughout time or are a recent phenomenon.  By identifying possible new triggers of cyanotoxin production, monitoring efforts can begin to include Fe analysis to see if low Fe concentrations could be a factor causing cyanotoxin production thus allowing for predictions and models to be developed.  This increased understanding could benefit lake recreation and water treatment facilities to include measures that prevent or lessen cyanotoxin production.   The outreach for this project included training and education at multiple levels throughout K-12 and collegiate students.  A female graduate student at Auburn University was the primary student leader for the project, which served as her Master?s Thesis.  Multiple graduate and undergraduate students were trained in both field and laboratory techniques as part of this project with two undergraduates conducting research on various aspects of the project.  In addition to multiple presentations at scientific meetings, results from this project were shared with elementary groups, 4-H clubs, and prisoners in the Alabama prison system as part of the Auburn SPARKS program.  Finally, this project served as the focus of two summer undergraduate internships through the Auburn University ?Research for Undergraduate Education (REU)? resulting in several presentations and outreach experiences.
