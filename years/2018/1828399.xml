<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor David Mootoo from CUNY Hunter College and colleagues Charles Drain and Matthew Devany have upgraded the console of a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer and have equipped the spectrometer with a liquid nitrogen cryoprobe. This upgraded spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as those that allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is useful to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The cryogenic probe provides a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes which permit use of small samples. The instrument is used for research and research training at this urban university and neighboring schools. Education and training in the science of NMR data interpretation is being accomplished in three overlapping ways: (1) via one-on-one interactions and workshops with the facility director; (2) in undergraduate courses and research experiences for undergraduates; and (3) through outreach activities that include demonstrations to high school and undergraduate students, for example, in the CUNY Math &amp; Science Partnership Program.  This award provides research infrastructure that will benefit the national health, and innovation in industry as well as technical workforce development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The upgraded NMR spectrometer with a cryoprobe enhances research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies of small molecules, biopolymers and natural product discovery. The instrument is used to establish combinatorial libraries and to search for biomechanistic probes. In addition, the spectrometer is used in the preparation of scaffolds for nanotechnology materials, and functionalized lipids and dyes. The instrument also serves researchers investigating materials for fuel cells and batteries, and for quantitation of small molecules in agricultural products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
