<AbstractNarration>The 2018 TPRC46 Research Conference on Communications, Information and Internet Policy will take place Friday and Saturday, September 21-22 2018, at the American University Washington College of Law in Washington D.C. TPRC promotes interdisciplinary thinking on current and emerging issues in communications and the Internet by disseminating and discussing new research relevant to policy questions in the U.S. and around the world. It serves researchers, policymakers, and members of the private sector and civil society, from students to well-established practitioners. This award assists approximately 15 U.S.-based graduate students to attend this conference. Participation in conferences such as TPRC forms a central part of the graduate school experience, providing students with an opportunity to interact with senior researchers from academia and industry, and exposing them to leading-edge research and thinking in the various fields of expertise. TPRC brings together computer scientists, network researchers, policymakers, and members of the private sector and civil society. Attending TPRC presents an excellent opportunity for U.S. graduate students to connect with a thriving international research community. The support requested in this proposal will enable students to attend the main conference, panels and paper presentations as well as the Graduate Student Consortium (GSC) at TPRC46 2018. This program will expose students to new ideas in these emerging areas, and allow them to interact with researchers outside their disciplines, including legal, economic, social science and technology scholars, thereby broadening their intellectual horizons. A special day of the conference dedicated to the GSC helps to ensure students are engaged and maximize the benefit from attending the conference. The GSC provides graduate students with opportunities for mentoring by academics, industry, and government leaders, as well as the opportunity to network with other graduate students. GSC participants will gain insights on research strategies and topics of interest from members of the TPRC community representing various industries and sectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates research and education with a target of computer science students and exposure to a premier interdisciplinary conference covering challenges in national and international policy on communications, information, and the Internet. The TPRC conference has developed into a top-tier international conference, presenting a tremendous opportunity to students to expand their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical perspective. The travel grant co-chairs are committed to encouraging the participation of women and under-represented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
