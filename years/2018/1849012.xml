<AbstractNarration>The rate of primary production in the ocean is fundamental to the ocean's food web and the movement of carbon from surface waters to the deep ocean, known as the biological pump. Yet spatial and temporal variations in primary productivity are poorly known because the effort required for the current method of measuring primary productivity is significant, limiting its application, and the method has biases that are difficult to quantify. Using a novel combination of approaches, the investigators will estimate daily primary productivity in the ocean at three ecologically distinct sites. The research will significantly improve understanding of primary productivity variations and their impact on the ocean's biological pump, which will benefit the broader ocean community involved in carbon cycle modeling and benefit society via the impact of ocean primary productivity on atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake and future climate change. The research results will be incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate course curricula and outreach talks at the two institutions. There will be active undergraduate student participation in the project at both Oregon State University and the University of Washington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the last decade, an in-situ primary productivity method based on measuring the isotopic composition of dissolved oxygen (O2) gas has gained traction within the oceanographic community because it yields a primary production estimate from a simple water sample collection. This method has yielded basin-wide snapshots of primary productivity based on underway sampling of the surface ocean by ships of opportunity. However, accurate estimates of oxygen/particulate organic carbon (O2/POC) produced during primary productivity are needed to convert oxygen-based primary production rates to carbon production. In this project, daily in-situ rates of primary production in the surface ocean at three ocean sites will be estimated from continuous measurements of diurnal cycles in the oxygen/argon dissolved gas ratio and POC and compared to simultaneous in vitro primary productivity estimates. Variations in the O2/POC produced during primary production will be determined. Autonomous float-based estimates of primary production based on measurements of diurnal cycles in O2 and POC will be validated using ship based measurements. Estimates of primary production based on autonomous measurements resulting from this research have the potential to revolutionize our knowledge on the spatial and temporal variations in primary productivity in the ocean.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The rate of primary production (PP) in the ocean is a significant and highly variable component of the global carbon cycle which also drives the biogeochemical cycling of major chemical elements such as nitrate, phosphate, and silicate. The magnitude of this rate sets the carrying capacity of the ocean, the upper boundary of export production and drives air-sea CO2 exchange. Yet, despite its importance in the earth’s carbon cycle, the rate of PP in the ocean is not particularly well constrained; uncertainties are most significant when comparing rates measured in the sea (in situ) versus in a bottle (in vitro) and /or comparing currencies (e.g. oxygen to carbon).  The present uncertainty in PP measurements must be addressed by the oceanographic community as accurate estimations of primary and community production are essential to understanding the ecological consequences of climate change on the base of the oceanic food chain.  To address this issue, we used high precision measurements of the diel cycles of dissolved O2, O2/Ar and particulate carbon to estimate gross PP, community respiration (CR) and net community production (NCP) at several sites across the nutrient depleted and nutrient replete regions of the N. Pacific Ocean.  In Henderikx Freitas, White, and Quay (2020) published in Global Biogeochemical Cycles (https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GB006518), we describe daily in situ rate measurements of gross production and community respiration estimated from high frequency diel cycles in oxygen (O2) and optically derived particulate carbon from several platforms (both ship-based and via profiling floats)  across an ecological gradient in the North Pacific spanning the high nutrient/low chlorophyll subarctic to the oligotrophic subtropical gyre.

We consistently found that gross production and community respiration rates were in approximate balance at all stations across the full ecological gradient, implying that community respiration is fueled by recently produced organic matter and that recycling efficiency (~90%) is similar along the gradient. We determined that phytoplankton turnover time doubles (from 2 to 4 days) between subtropical and subpolar regimes whereas biomass increases by ~10-fold. We found a consistent photosynthetic quotient (1.4 &plusmn; 0.2 mol O2 mol C-1), respiratory quotient (1.0 &plusmn; 0.2 mol O2 mol C-1), and gross to net production ratio (2.0 &plusmn; 0.3) at all stations which underscores the surprising similarity of fundamental ecological characteristics despite the transition from nutrient deplete to replete conditions.  These findings have two major implications for future work: (1) they present an entirely novel means for constraining spatial and temporal changes in the photosynthetic and respiratory quotients and (2) given that the float- and ship- based estimates of in situ production and respiration generally agreed well suggests that float-based diel O2 and POC measurements have the potential to greatly expand our knowledge of spatial and temporal variability of productivity and respiration in the ocean.  In Henderikx Freitas, White et al. (2020) published in the journal Applied Optics (https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.394123), we expanded on our understanding of the diel periodicity of optical proxies for carbon (beam attenuation, cp and particulate backscattering, bbp) by pairing these measurements with in situ flow cytometric measurements of microbial diversity and particle size distributions in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The aim was to understand how community composition may alter coherence of the diel cycles we have measured. We observed clear and coherent diel cycles in all bulk and size-fractionated optical proxies for particle biomass.
