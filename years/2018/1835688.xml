<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The development of biodegradable materials represents a revolution in science and has led to significant biotechnological advancements in drug delivery, biomaterials, tissue engineering, and medical devices. Hybrid materials, composed of both organic and inorganic components, illustrate a new field of basic research that has attracted a great deal of attention for designing novel biodegradable and biocompatible composites. In particular, hybrid systems that can efficiently transport and release photosensitizing agents can make a tremendous impact in novel alternatives to treat diseases such as photodynamic therapy. The overall goal of this EAGER project is to develop novel biodegradable multifunctional hybrid polysilsesquioxane nanoparticles to carry photosensitizing agents. By fine tuning the chemical features of polysilsesquioxane nanoparticles, the degradability of these materials under specific conditions and their interaction with mammalian cells can be controlled. The success of the proposed work will open new synthetic avenues to fabricate biodegradable hybrid polysilsesquioxane materials for transporting photosensitizing agents. The fundamental knowledge developed by the proposed research will provide a deeper understanding of the interaction and photochemistry of polysilsesquioxane nanoparticles inside mammalian cells. The multidisciplinary research involving chemistry, materials science, cell biology and nanomedicine provides ample opportunities to train and educate students at undergraduate and graduate levels. Moreover, the -Think Big, Do Nano- outreach program is designed to foster public awareness, engagement, and understanding of nanoscale science and nanotechnology in the Charlotte community at all levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;The development of biodegradable hybrid materials represents a revolution in medicine that led to significant biotechnological advancements in biomaterials and tissue engineering. Despite the impressive success of composite-based platforms, the need for smarter, more precise and optimally tuned carriers is critical. Therefore, the development of alternative nanoparticle-based strategies to conventional composite systems is imperative. Hybrid platforms offer optimized structural, chemical, optical and mechanical features, besides other suitable characteristics such as biodegradability and biocompatibility for their application as biomaterials. This EAGER award supported by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of North Carolina Charlotte focuses on developing biodegradable multifunctional polysilsesquioxane (PSilQ) nanoparticles (NPs) for carrying photosensitizing agents. The specific aims of this proposal include: I) Design, synthesize and characterize biodegradable PSilQ NPs that undergo degradation upon encountering a high reducing environment or acidic pH; II) Test the photophysical and photochemical properties of PSilQ NPs in solution and in vitro; and III) Study the mechanisms of endocytosis, intracellular transportation, and degradation of PSilQ NPs. Exposure of underrepresented minority students to this research is expected to engage students in new and exciting ways, and advance NSFs goal to broaden participation among underrepresented populations in STEM and STEM research. In addition, this project integrates an outreach program, -Think Big, Do Nano-, designed to foster public awareness, engagement, and understanding of nanoscale science and nanotechnology in the Charlotte community at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
