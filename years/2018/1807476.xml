<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;With its two protons and two neutrons, helium-4 is one of the simplest atoms next to hydrogen. However, although apparently simple, helium has very complex behavior at low temperatures due quantum mechanical effects. One type of these effects is that helium will not freeze under normal pressures, but rather will remain a liquid all the way down to absolute zero (T = 0 K). In order to get helium to freeze, it must be squeezed to over 25 times atmospheric pressure, essentially forcing the atoms into a solid. Another consequence of the quantum nature of helium is the possibility that this strange solid can display superfluid properties (i.e. flow without friction). This is an idea that, although very strange, is predicted to occur under the right conditions, but experiments have had mixed results in detecting such a phase. This project studies the electronic properties of helium and exploits these properties to develop a new route to creating solid helium. This new method of growing solid helium crystals gives researchers a certain amount of control over system parameters that have been typically inaccessible to other solid helium experiments. The research also studies quantum effects in solid helium grown using this new method, with the goal of observing superfluidity in solid helium. Finally, this project engages undergraduate students in low temperature physics experiments at California State University, Sacramento (Sacramento State), which is primarily an undergraduate institution serving a large, ethnically diverse student body. Through this research, under-represented minority students, develop a range of highly technical skills, helping to bring diversity to the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Superfluid properties have so far been conclusively observed in liquids and gasses. This begs the question: can superfluid properties exist in solids as well? This question has captivated low temperature physicists for over 50 years. Due to its quantum nature, it is believed that solid helium has the best chance of displaying superfluid behavior, although experimental searches have been met with varying success. This project brings a new perspective to solid helium research by studying electronic properties of solid helium in order to develop a new method of creating solid helium. Specifically, an external electric field is used to control the dipole-dipole interactions that are the basis of inter-atomic interactions between neutral helium atoms. Given the right conditions, these dipolar interactions cause the atoms to form a lattice, creating "dipolar solid helium". With this method, the low temperature research team at California State University, Sacramento, studies the differences in the behavior of a classically-behaved solid and a quantum solid leading to the possibility of observing superfluid behavior in the solid, or a, "supersolid" phase. Specific goals of this project are to: 1) observe the formation and behavior of dipolar solid helium under varying interaction strengths; 2) measure the electronic properties of both conventional and dipolar solid helium; and 3) build a low temperature cryostat that is conducive to undergraduate research. These experiments build a framework for a large range of future experiments that will study the behavior of a dipolar quantum solid. Such experiments offer insights into the behavior of materials that are important as technologies get smaller, and approach the limit where quantum effects become important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
