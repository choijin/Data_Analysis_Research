<AbstractNarration>Rural Washington has a strong demand for environmental and natural resource technicians with knowledge and skills in geospatial tools, data, and analysis.  However, rural schools have challenges in meeting performance benchmarks in STEM disciplines needed for geospatial careers, including technical careers in environmental and natural resources. The reasons for lower rural school STEM outcomes are complex. Cited factors for lower rural school performance in preparing students for STEM career pathways include a fewer number of experienced STEM teachers, fewer resources, and geographic isolation. This project explores the opportunity to better leverage community college resources to overcome barriers of geographic isolation.  Specifically, the project aims to expand the number of rural high school teachers with training in geospatial applications that are relevant to the region.  In addition, it aims to increase dual-credit (high-school and college) geospatial courses offered in rural communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will deliver geospatial professional development training to twelve high school teachers from four isolated rural school districts, with the potential to involve two additional districts. Three instructors from Spokane Community College who teach college-level courses in rural northeast Washington communities will join high school teachers as learners receiving professional development training, with the intent to expand the college's capacity to teach dual-credit courses on geospatial topics directly in rural communities. Over the course of the project, the PI and Co-PIs will deliver two 3-day workshops at one of five Spokane Community College rural (satellite) campus facilities. The participating high school teachers and rural college instructors will also receive additional resources to support independent exploration of geospatial tools, data, and applications for integration into their classroom teaching. These additional resources include the creation of locally relevant standards-mapped GIS learning activities for high school classrooms. Rural communities and industries can benefit from an expanded number of students who pursue STEM career pathways that prepare them for meaningful local job opportunities and support local workforce needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
