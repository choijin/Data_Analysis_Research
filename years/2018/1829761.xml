<AbstractNarration>Iron (Fe) is a crucial nutrient for microbial growth in the oceans, impacting the carbon cycle and the climate system, but Fe does not dissolve readily in seawater and so its availability limits phytoplankton growth over much of the surface oceans. One of the most significant ways by which Fe reaches the surface oceans is through deposition of wind-blown dust; however, for this Fe to be available for biological growth, it must dissolve and be kept in solution bound to organic molecules. Despite this known importance, the mechanisms of dust dissolution and the identity of the organic molecules keeping Fe in solution remain poorly understood. This study will focus on using laboratory and field experiments to better understand how natural organic molecules present in seawater enhance the release of Fe from Saharan desert dust, the organic molecules produced by microbes in response to dust, the isotopic fractionation of Fe associated with dust dissolution, and ultimately the role of ligand-mediation dissolution in determining the role of dust in the marine Fe cycle. For outreach activities, the proposers would tutor refugee high school students from Africa/Asia in math and science to help them get integrated into the U.S. school system and discuss science with the public by participation in the St. Petersburg Science Festival.  Three graduate students and undergraduate interns would be supported and trained as part of this project.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Scientists from the University of South Florida and Oregon State University will collect natural North Atlantic dust at the Tudor Hill Tower on Bermuda over a yearly cycle and characterize the weekly bulk and water-soluble Fe isotopic and elemental composition of the dust. Appropriate subsamples of this dust, representing both the Saharan and non-Saharan (anthropogenically-influenced) seasons will then be dissolved in seawater, with dissolution mediated by ligands with a range of Fe binding stability constants (natural ligands as well as defined marine siderophores). Incubations of dust will also be carried out with natural biological communities collected from the Gulf of Mexico and at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series site in the North Atlantic. The investigators will characterize the amount and isotopic signature of the Fe released in each experiment, the microbial community response to dust in the incubations (DNA, cell counting and identification), and the ligands present in the natural organic matter used for experiments and produced in the incubations. Comparison of the abiotic and biological experiments will allow investigation of the magnitude of the biological effects on dust dissolution. The experiments will allow the investigators to provide a mechanistic understanding of factors that affect dust dissolution rates, especially the role of different specific organic ligands in enhancing and stabilizing the release of iron in the surface ocean, and the net signature of iron released. From this, the investigators will provide new constraints for the marine iron isotope cycle in the ocean, specifically testing the hypothesis that the net release of Fe from dust is isotopically heavy due to complexation with organic ligands, but that the size of this fractionation depends on the binding strength and presence of different ligands. The outcomes of this process study will provide a framework for models and interpretation of large scale field studies such as GEOTRACES, as well as enhancing the research community's ability to interpret aerosol and oceanic iron isotope data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
