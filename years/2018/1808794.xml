<AbstractNarration>In this research project, the principal investigator will continue work that aims to provide a human-readable proof of the four color map theorem.  The four color map theorem was first proved in 1976 by Appel and Haken; the proof involved a huge amount of case checking, so much so that the only feasible method of attack was via computer.  This machine-assisted proof, however, cannot be directly checked by a human.  Although there have been some subsequent simplifications and clarifications, the general brute-force approach has seemed to be the only line of attack.  The four color theorem can be rephrased, though, as a question about the topology of three-dimensional manifolds, and in particular new tools inspired by high energy physics give novel ways to approach a conceptual proof of the four color theorem.  This project explores and develops these new insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator and collaborator define a version of instanton Floer homology for trivalent graphs embedded in three-manifolds. This theory enables them to place the four color map theorem firmly in the context of gauge-theory-inspired invariants of three-manifolds. They have proved a fundamental non-vanishing theorem for this Floer homology group, reducing the four color map theorem to a question about computing this invariant for general planar graphs.  They are developing new tools for the computation of these and related invariants, and they have discovered a spectral sequence relevant to this computation.  The collapse of the spectral sequence for planar graphs would imply the four color theorem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
