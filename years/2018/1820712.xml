<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Elena Caceres at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Einstein's theory of general relativity is one of the bedrocks of modern science.  But general relativity is not enough to describe the interior of black holes or the earliest stages of our universe.  In both cases the laws of physics become quantum-mechanical and we therefore need a theory of gravity which is also consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics.  String theory has long been considered the best candidate for such a theory.   Approximately twenty years ago this led to the discovery of the so-called "holographic principle".  This remarkable principle allows us to relate quantum-mechanical theories of gravity with other theories that do not involve gravity at all.  As a result, intractable problems in certain gravitational theories are translated into non-gravitational problems --- problems which are often far simpler to solve.  In her research, Professor Caceres aims to develop a further understanding of this correspondence.  Progress in this direction will ultimately provide insights into the physics of the early universe, the interior of black holes, and ultimately the nature of spacetime itself.  As such, this research advances the national interest by fostering the development of basic science within the United States.  This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Caceres will involve graduate students and postdocs in her research, thereby providing training for junior physicists.  Professor Caceres will also develop a mentorship program to help lower the high attrition rate of underrepresented minorities studying physics at the undergraduate level.  Finally, Professor Caceres will also give talks at middle schools and high schools with high percentages of minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a more technical level, Professor Caceres will investigate causal holographic constructs in higher-derivative theories and use these constructs to constrain the space of higher-derivative theories that can have a QFT dual.  She will also study the consequences of the causal structure of higher-derivative theories in the "complexity equals action" conjecture and in the "subregion complexity - action" proposal.  Concerning traversable wormholes arising from a boundary deformation, Professor Caceres will study traversability in charged wormholes, in wormholes in backgrounds dual to non-commutative theories, and in solutions of higher-derivative theories.  She will also investigate the effects of couplings with a spatial profile at the boundary of the opening of the traversable wormhole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
