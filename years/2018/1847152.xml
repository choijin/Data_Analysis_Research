<AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Understanding how neurons and immune cells in the brain communicate with each other through the exchange of neurotransmitters and cytokines could reveal new signaling pathways that are crucial to treating various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Neurons typically release various types of neurotransmitters to correspond with neighboring cells, while immune cells commonly release cytokines to modulate immune responses. Recent discoveries provide strong evidence suggesting bi-directional communication between neurotransmitters and cytokines for the purpose of modulating one another. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the dynamics of both of these species interactively and simultaneously in a closed-loop system, where one or more types of neurotransmitters can influence a series of cytokines, and vice versa. This project investigates novel biosensing strategies and the development of a fully integrated device platform that can simultaneously measure the neurochemicals and cytokines from neurons and immune cells, respectively, as they are released. Successful implementation of this technology will greatly impact the neuroscience community by elucidating the intricate signaling pathways and the mechanisms through which neuroinflammation and immune responses occur in the brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this project is to implement an integrated biosensing platform that enables real-time measurement of the key neurochemicals and inflammatory cytokines from cells in situ as they are secreted. To achieve this goal, the following strategies will be applied: (1) Molecular templating will be used to implement a novel polymer-based target receptor that will enhance the selectivity in analyte recognition; (2) The electrochemical sensing technique will be integrated with a graphene field-effect transistor to enhance signal amplification and sensitivity in analyte detection; and (3) A lab-on-a-chip device that integrates the cell culture system and the biosensing components will be implemented. The educational objective of this project is to utilize the research activities as a platform to train the current and the next generation of STEM workforce. This will be achieved through the following strategic approaches: (1) Training the next generation of scientists and engineers through K-12 outreach activities; (2) Preparing engineers- and scientists-in-training through undergraduate and graduate education and mentoring; and (3) Supporting the current industrial workforce by implementing an online graduate certificate program. These educational activities will expose the students in various stages in their STEM career to the areas of (1) microfabrication of microfluidic devices, (2) the concepts of biosensing and bioelectronics, and (3) nanomaterial- and transistor-based detection of biomolecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
