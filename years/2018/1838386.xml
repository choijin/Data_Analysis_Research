<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research aimed at understanding the relationships between plasticity of amorphous solids and the jamming transition. It is generally accepted that the mechanical properties of crystals are controlled by their defects; however for amorphous solids, no such consensus has been reached.  There is now mounting evidence for two different kinds of critical behavior in athermal, repulsive systems such as suspensions of soft particles or granular materials. On one hand, amorphous solids exhibit a kind of dynamical critical behavior similar to other depinning systems as they are driven at vanishing shear rate. On the other hand, confined random packings of repulsive particles exhibit critical behavior in their elastic response as the confining pressure vanishes. The key issue of the interplay between these behaviors during slow shear at low confinement pressure remains relatively unexplored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will perform massively parallel computer simulations of suspensions of soft and hard particle systems under shear to identify the mechanisms for stress buildup and relaxation in various regimes of particle stiffness, packing density, and shearing rate. The spatio-temporal structure of these processes will be studied using emerging tools developed for supercooled liquids and glasses. The PI will address whether the dynamically critical behavior observed in systems above jamming persists at the jamming transition and, more generally, how proximity to the jamming transition affects spatio-temporal structures that allow shear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational activities lie along three main thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The undergraduate curriculum development will involve the infusion of numerical modeling into core upper division coursework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) The graduate curriculum development will involve the design and implementation of an introduction to statistical physics for engineering and theoretical mechanics students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) The secondary education outreach will be done in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in the context of a program which involves high school teachers from the Pittsburgh public schools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research aimed at a fundamental understanding of how amorphous materials behave when subjected to external forces.  Many amorphous materials behave like ordinary solids without external forces. Even though they lack any underlying crystalline order, they hold their shape.  A few of the many examples from everyday experience include windows (made of glass or plexiglass), mayonnaise, and sand on the beach.  When the external forces become sufficiently large, the particles which make up these solids start to flow as if the material were a liquid and the material is said to undergo "plastic yield".  In crystalline materials, plastic yielding has been understood for many decades to be governed by extended defects in the crystal structure known as "dislocations".  In the amorphous solids, a microscopic understanding of plastic yielding is only beginning to emerge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a certain subclass of these amorphous solids, e.g. the grains of sand, the constituent particles interact through purely repulsive forces.  In this repulsive case, the materials can only behave like a solid when external forces confine the particles and force them to interact with each other.  In such a confined state, the particles are said to be "jammed".  At the transition point when the confinement is just about to be released, the elastic properties of the material are known to be completely anomalous, unlike anything observed in ordinary solids.  Therefore, it is important to ask whether the system will yield via the same mechanism near jamming.  The PI will perform very large-scale computer simulations and theoretical analysis to address this question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational activities lie along three main thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The undergraduate curriculum development will involve the infusion of numerical modeling into core upper division coursework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) The graduate curriculum development will involve the design and implementation of an introduction to statistical physics for engineering and theoretical mechanics students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) The secondary education outreach will be done in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in the context of a program which involves high school teachers from the Pittsburgh public schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this research was to support the PI’s CAREER development in terms of research and education/curriculum development.  The work was at the intersection of plastic deformation of amorphous solids and the jamming transition.      Intellectual Merit:    Amorphous matter comprises a huge fraction of the materials we encounter in everyday life, from the toothpaste we use to brush our teeth, to the soil we build our houses on, to the silica-based glasses we use in solar panels and cell phone displays.  Despite their ubiquity in industry, technology, and nature, mechanical theories of these materials are primitive compared to their crystalline counterparts where theories based on defects (vacancies, substitutional defects, dislocations, grain boundaries, etc.) are quite mature.    Theories describing deformation in amorphous materials have really only begun to mature in the last ten years.  They have generally invoked the notion of clusters of particles (e.g. atoms in a metallic alloy or sand grains at the bottom of a pile of sand), which rearrange locally when stressed in rough analogy to the motion of a dislocation in a crystal.  When the globally applied stresses are large enough, the whole sample will deform, much like the toothpaste flows out of the tube when the pressure is sufficiently large.  This transition is known as yielding.   At the same time, some of these amorphous materials are special in that they require confinement to behave like a solid.  For example, a bucket of sand will not behave like a solid unless some external force, e.g. gravity, presses the sand grains together.  The transition at which point the particles are confined so that the assembly begins to behave like a solid is known as the jamming transition.      This project used particle-based computer simulations and theoretical analysis to address both the jamming transition and the yielding transition and the intersection between them where a jammed material is driven towards yielding.  Several important findings related to the emergence of various characteristic length scales at jamming.  In particular, static packings were generated and probed with various types of forcing.  It was found that if one looked at transverse or longitudinal projections different characteristic lengths could be extracted.       Well above the jamming transition, the particle-scale motions that allow for macroscopic deformation are much like more conventional amorphous materials like amorphous metallic alloys or colloidal suspensions with attractive interactions.
