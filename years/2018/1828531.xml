<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  Professor Igor Rubtsov from Tulane University has developed a dual-frequency two-dimensional infrared, attenuated total reflectance (2DIR ATR) spectrometer.  The spectrum which is obtained measures structural features of molecules in thin films including monolayers. The spectrometer uses three infrared beams to probe a sample.  The reflectance mode of operation (ATR) and addition of special nano-antenna provides higher sensitivity than usually obtained with 2D-IR spectrometers. This enables measurements of small thin samples such as membranes, surfaces and thin films which are heretofore inaccessible. One area of research is directed at understanding how the physical properties of the membranes change with their composition and structure. Changes in membrane properties are important for a range of neurodegenerative disorders. Training of graduate students in instrument development occurs. Undergraduates from Tulane and Xavier University (LA) are trained in the technique.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This spectrometer provides deeper insights in fields such as biophysics and heterogeneous catalysis. The structure and dynamics of self-assembled monolayers that have various applications ranging from light-harvesting to sensing is studied as well as  monolayer stability.  Breakdown process in composites for energy storage are probed to understand what causes the breakdown. The mechanism of how a metal adheres to a polymer surface (double-layer formation) is studied to understand the process. Carbon dioxide activation using enzymes found in in aerobic soil-dwelling bacteria is investigated.  Research with self-assembled monolayers (SAMS) is conducted. This is a model system to understand the possible role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cancer metastasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
