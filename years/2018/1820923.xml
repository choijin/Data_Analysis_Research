<AbstractNarration>The Saint Louis Area Methods Meeting (SLAMM) provides a unique opportunity for participants. It is large enough to attract high quality researchers, but small enough for individuals to get important feedback on their work and develop mentoring and professional networks. The graduate students funded by this project stand to benefit in both ways. First, the work that they present will get critical comments from leading methodologists and statisticians. In addition to the senior scholars presenting, several others will attend the conference as discussants. Theses senior scholars will include guests from other universities as well as members of the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University, which will encourage interdisciplinary work. Getting feedback on their research posters from these scholars will significantly improve the quality of their work. Second, the connections the graduate students make with the faculty have the potential to have long lasting effects. Students will be assigned a specific mentor and the individualized relationship will hopefully last beyond this meeting. These networking connections can have lasting effects on a person's scholarship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation of the graduate students at SLAMM has clear implications for their educational success. Many of the students will be presenting dissertation related research and the feedback will improve their education experiences. In addition, the many of graduate students will be from underrepresented groups, which have traditionally not participated in these types of meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On April 20, 2018, Drs. Olga Chyzh, Mark Nieman, and David Peterson hosted a diverse and interdisciplinary group of scholars at Iowa State University for the 2018 St. Louis Area Methods Meeting (SLAMM).  SLAMM is one of the oldest and largest meetings in Political Science focused on political methodology.  It was a one day event hosted in Ames, IA.  For the conference, four political scientists presented cutting edge research on political methodology and received extensive feedback from the attendees.   The event contained a poster session for graduates students to present their work and a mentoring lunch where graduate students were partnered with faculty.  The poster session gave the graduate students the opportunity to receive feedback on their research from leading statisticians, computer scientists, and political scientists.      In addition to the one day SLAMM event, there was a continuing political methodology speaker series designed to continue the mentoring of graduate students.  A diverse set of speakers cam to Ames over the following 18 months to present their work and mentor graduate students.  These speakers met individually with graduate students to provide mentoring for the graduate students’ research.     These types of small conferences and speaker series are unique opportunities for graduate students.  The intellectual merit of these efforts is the support and mentoring of graduate students.  Their research benefitted from the advice and comments from leaders in the field.  The feedback from the graduate students who attended SLAMM was universally positive.  They all described their experience as positive, particularly the opportunity to get feedback on their research and expand their network in the discipline.  The mentoring from the speaker series also contributed to 3 of the Master’s students at ISU to go on to Ph.D. programs.      The broader impacts of the project include supporting a diverse group of graduate students.  26 graduate students attended SLAMM.  One half of these were women and four were from traditionally underrepresented groups.  While the faculty presenting their work were not supported by this funding, half of the presenters and discussants were female as were the majority of the speakers supported as part of the speaker series.
