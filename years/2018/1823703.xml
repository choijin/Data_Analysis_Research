<AbstractNarration>Electoral campaigns are a defining feature of democratic polities-they influence voters' choices and set expectations for how elected representatives will serve their constituents. Yet, studying campaigns and their effects is difficult. This is particularly true when it comes to situations where numerous elections are taking place in a single country at one time. In this project, the PIs build on data that have been collected since 2002, analyzing large samples of candidate websites and conducting surveys of candidate campaigns. These data provide a holistic picture of a wide range of campaigns-both winners and losers-and offer scholars and citizens the ability to assess what campaigns do, why they do it, and how it might relate to subsequent governing. The intellectual merit to the project is that the data will allow scholars and citizens access to unprecedented data about how those looking to represent the populace behave and the type of discourse they employ.  The broader impact is that the enhanced understanding of campaigns that these data will provide will enable practitioners to identify sources of political change and discuss reforms that could ultimately improve campaign quality. The project also will involve students who will learn how to conduct research and be able to use the data in their own work.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the United States, citizens choose their representatives in part based on campaigns. Yet, campaigns are difficult to study as they involve so many candidates, many of whom run relatively low-cost, small campaigns. One way to obtain a representative sample of campaign discourse is to rely on candidate websites since virtually all candidates have websites. Websites also are ideal insofar as campaigns view them as holistic portraits of messages aimed at voters. Since 2002, the PIs have coded campaign websites and conducted surveys of campaigns. The result is an unprecedented data set of campaign behavior over-time. In this project, the PIs will extend that data into the upcoming election, which is of particular interest given increased affective polarization and incivility, and the nationalization of elections. The intellectual merit to the project is that it will allow scholars and citizens access to data about how those looking to represent the populace behave and the type of discourse they employ. Further, it will enable scholars to track the evolution of the Internet and technology over time, and test theories of campaigns and their effects on voters and representatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we archived and coded the content of hundreds of Congressional campaign websites during the 2018 election. We also coded the content of representatives’ official U.S. House and Senate websites during legislative sessions between 2017 and 2019. We have added these data to an extensive dataset on Congressional campaign behavior and representation that covers the period from 2002 to 2020 and has benefited from several rounds of National Science Foundation funding.  Our data collection has provided insight into how Congressional campaigns work, how they relate to legislative representative responsiveness, and in what ways they affect voters. Our main finding is that innovative web technologies are not widely used and that candidate status (e.g., incumbency) plays an important role in determining campaign behavior (controlling for dozens of other dynamics).   We also find that funds raised and race competitiveness matter but to a lesser extent. Perhaps most important is that candidates who are most likely to win office (i.e., incumbents) avoid extensive web-based interaction with voters, thereby reducing the potential for a highly deliberative campaign and representation environment.   The intellectual merit of the project is multifaceted.  It will help scholars to track the evolution of the Internet’s use in political campaigns and the legislative branch over time.  It also allows scholars an opportunity to test theories about campaign effects on voters and representatives using a unique, unmediated dataset of campaign communications.   The project has a broad impact insofar as it will contribute to knowledge about political campaigns.  Researchers will be able to test theories of campaigns to understand their effects and potentially be able to propose reforms to how campaigns are conducted.  Researchers will also be able to evaluate connections between candidate campaign behavior and how representatives govern.   Some findings from the data will be published in peer reviewed journals. Past rounds of funding for this research have led to peer-reviewed publications that have contributed to knowledge about Congressional candidate behavior, campaign communications on the Internet, and voter processing of online campaign communications.      Our project has included many students who learned about research, content analysis, survey methods, and political behavior. Many of them have used the data themselves to write papers, which has been a very valuable experience, especially for those who have gone on to graduate school. Dozens of other researchers have also used our data for their own studies. As such, this project has benefited the public, students, and scholars.  The archived data and future releases of recently collected data will further support research on Congressional campaigns and representation.
