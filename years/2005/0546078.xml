<AbstractNarration>The proposed project explores the use of the concept of students' science identities as a factor in evaluating the effectiveness of science pedagogies. The investigator aims to push evaluations of pedagogies beyond questions about what students know and can do to questions about how effective pedagogies are in producing students with long-term senses of themselves as science learners and participants. The objectives of the project are: 1) to determine what counts as meaningful scientific practice in standards-based classrooms at different grade levels through discourse analysis and surveys; 2) to chart the development of students' understanding of and attitudes toward science over time; 3) to identify specific teaching practices, at different grade levels, that those understandings and attitudes; and 4) to develop professional development materials designed to support teachers' efforts to foster those practices that improve student attitudes, practices, and understanding of science. This project will engage teachers, pre-service teachers, and graduate students in professional development experiences that dovetail with research objectives. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Good science teaching matters. This claim seems self-evident, but it has been remarkably under-examined. The justification for good science teaching is that it promotes studentsÆ knowledge and understanding of scientific ideas and abilities to conduct scientific inquiry. But, does it promote students who want to understand the world scientifically? Students who increasingly recognize themselves and get recognized by others as science people? Can science interest cultivated in one year endure over the longer term? For whom? These questions push science educationÆs definition of "effectiveness" beyond producing students who know and can do science to questions about studentsÆ enduring sense of self as science learners, doers, and future participants. These are questions about studentsÆ identities as science learners. Good science education is about cultivating studentsÆ identities as science learners&mdash; their competence in and successful performance of relevant scientific practices, meaningful knowledge and understanding of science, motivation to understand the world scientifically, and recognition of self and by others as scientific. The projectÆs goals and outcomes are described below.  Goals #1 and #2. Determine what counts as "meaningful scientific practice" in fourth- through sixth-grade classrooms, and identify specific teaching practices that cultivate strong scientific identities for a broad range of students.  Through ethnographic studies of 7 elementary and middle school classrooms that involved hundreds of hours of video-recorded classroom observation, as well as teacher, student, and parent interviews, and student surveys, our research team created design principles for equitable science learning settings. An equitable science includes:  Practices that leverage studentsÆ social identities in service of their scientific understanding and engagement. For example, a student who is a natural leader is encouraged to use those talents in service of science learning and engagement. Teachers who hold students accountable to performing themselves scientifically. A good teacher co-creates the norms and practices for scientific work with students, makes accessible those norms and practices for all learners, and holds all learners accountable for performing themselves in ways that align with the celebrated norms and practices. Practices that emphasize scientific knowledge as socially constructed versus individually owned. When students are held accountable for sharing knowledge, the space for what counts as "being scientific" is broadened considerably; all learners feel they have a stake in and responsibility for their peersÆ learning. Practices that minimize power differentials between "smart" and "struggling" students. School science often reproduces sorting mechanisms and hierarchies between students who seem to "naturally" understand science and those who do not.  Practices that connect students to established disciplinary networks so that they can thrive in the science pipeline.     Goal #3. Chart studentsÆ science identity development over time as they experience different science teaching.  Primary findings include:  One year of excellent science teaching engendered diverse studentsÆ scientific understanding, interest, and identities. However, this gain was not sustainable when the quality of school science instruction diminished.  All students, regardless of initial science interest and abilities, race, class, and gender, were affected negatively by more narrow, traditional school science as they progressed from elementary to middle school. The science trajectories of girls of color were most negatively affected. Some of the negative effects of narrow, traditional school science were countered by enriching out-of-school science experiences.    Intellectual merit.
