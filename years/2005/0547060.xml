<AbstractNarration>Hoffman-Kim&lt;br/&gt;0547060&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nerves fail to regenerate after injury and current medical practice is unable to manipulate effectively the process of nerve regeneration. This project will quantify how guidance cues, both individually and in combination, promote axon growth. The research results will provide an understanding of nerve development and of accurate and effective nerve regeneration.  The goal of this proposal is to study the guidance of axons by multiple cues, including topography and specific molecules on surfaces, using microfabrication and microfluidics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan focuses on increasing oral communication skills, namely public speaking, of undergraduate and first year graduate students. The students in two classes that the principal investigator (PI) teaches will give seminars to non-scientific audiences. The PI will also run a workshop to help faculty teach communication skills in their classes. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
