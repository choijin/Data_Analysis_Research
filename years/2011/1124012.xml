<AbstractNarration>Indiana University doctoral student Shingo Hamada, with the guidance of Dr. Richard Wilk, will undertake research on variability in how different social groups perceive and define successful marine conservation and the effects of that variability on actual marine resource recovery. The project's specific focus will be why herring restoration projects in Japan have developed in coastal communities in the last two decades, despite uncertain benefits both economically and ecologically. This research will contribute to improved understanding of the conditions in which multiple stakeholders engage in conservation efforts and the cumulative ecological effects of their engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will undertake thirteen months of fieldwork in a fishing community in Hokkaido, northern Japan, where he will focus on the herring industry. The herring industry is particularly important in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami because it has persisted while other fisheries are at risk. Hamada will conduct multiple semi-structured interviews and carry out participant observation in conservation-related events, such as reforestation activities and hatchery operations. He will recruit a wide range of informants, including fishers, seafood entrepreneurs, reforestation project participants and organizers, fishery scientists, and municipal administrators. The researcher will apply a series of social scientific research methods to determine the agreements and variations in the cultural values of herring and herring fishing among actors, and to identify how socio-cultural contexts influence the success of the restoration projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is important because many conservation projects fail to achieve social and environmental sustainability. Findings from this study will contribute to building theory on what brings about improved human-environment relations and successful collective environmental decision-making. The research also will contribute to the doctoral training of a social scientist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the support of a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant from the National Science Foundation, Shingo HamadaÆs research examined socio-political and cultural complexities of fisheries resource conservation, focusing on herring stock restoration research and projects. Coastal communities in Hokkaido experienced the collapse of herring fisheries in the late 1950s through 1960s.

It is generally believed that community-based resource conservation does not emerge if economic and ecological benefits are uncertain. Instead of reducing the matter of fisheries resource management into bio-economical modeling and labeling it as "fishermenÆs problems," this research showed the importance of examining and understanding cultural pluralism in collective action for resource conservation. Cultural values of resources and human-environment interaction vary, and they influence a success (or failure) of fisheries resource management. HamadaÆs ethnographic fieldwork revolved around tracing the presence of multiple ways of perceiving the herring and its ecosystem.  This research project investigated why locals continue herring restoration efforts even though the herring fishery is economically still a marginal part of the fishersÆ livelihood after a decade of conducting such and the success of restoration projects is uncertain in a both short and long run.
