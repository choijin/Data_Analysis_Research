<AbstractNarration>This project is investigating how remote access to real-time environmental data impacts students' motivation and cognition about environmental awareness. This project, which is a partnership between Virginia Tech (VT) and Virginia Western Community College (VWCC), investigates student motivation using the expectancy-value theory of motivation.  It primarily investigates the impact of the lab on students' problem solving skills using the phenomenology approach. The research results guide the development and implementation of sustainability learning modules into undergraduate curricula. The project uses a remote lab, called LabVIEW Enabled Watershed Assessment System (LEWAS), that has the capability to sense, store, and transmit real-time weather data, as well as water quality and quantity data from the Stroubles Creek that flows through the Virginia Tech campus.  The project is developing and implementing LEWAS-based learning modules for a freshman engineering course at both VT and VWCC and a senior level hydrology course.   Project activities include unique curriculum development, implementation, and assessment activities at three academic levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project between a 4-year and a 2-year institution introduces students at various academic levels to critical issues involved in finding solutions to one of the top two Grand Challenges (i.e., provide access to clean water) of the National Academy of Engineering. The hands-on water sustainability experiences have the potential to attract students into the engineering profession from a broad section of society.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this TUES Type I project was to implement the use of a remote lab (i.e., Learning Enhanced Watershed Assessment System, LEWAS) to enhance the quality of undergraduate instruction at Virginia Tech (VT) and Virginia Western Community College (VWCC), Roanoke. The project was executed at VT and VWCC, Roanoke during June 2012 to December 2015. The LEWAS and its cyberlearning system called Online Watershed Learning System (OWLS) introduced water monitoring issues using high frequency water data from VT campus to about 135 seniors and 15 graduate students in civil &amp; environmental engineering (CEE) at Virginia Tech. Two courses (Hydrology and Urban Hydrology) in CEE department are impacted significantly and students in these courses continue to use the LEWAS/OWLS-based learning activities. In addition, the LEWAS/OWLS-based learning activities have been introduced to engineering freshmen and various students in other engineering and non-engineering courses&nbsp; at VT. Further, this lab has expanded reearch opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at VT. Research completed as part of this project has shown that use of the LEWAS/OWLS as a remote lab within hybrid instruction increases students&rsquo; learning and motivation.
