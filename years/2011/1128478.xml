<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to discover a new class of ultra low power sensors. The approach is to develop nonlinear adaptive schemes that circumvent the tradeoffs faced by linear, time-invariant systems. This research aims at facilitating applications like mobile health, which rely on sensors with a limited power budget. In particular, this research will enable the brain-controlled cochlear implant - a next generation neural prosthetic that addresses the long-standing problem of speech intelligibility in a noisy background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Nonlinear analysis can identify those regions of sensor data that are critical for an application's computations and state changes. Further, an adaptive system can adjust its parameters and resource consumption to specifically accommodate such computationally-relevant data, while discarding the remaining, less relevant data. These nonlinear and adaptive schemes result in very power-efficient sensors, and the proposed project will realize them by methodically harnessing the inherent nonlinear dynamics of analog components. In this way, the project aims to advance the field of low power sensor design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The mobile health devices that this project enables will promote a preventative, decentralized model of health-care delivery. This could allay the rising cost of health care. The project will integrate nonlinear systems thinking into engineering teaching through outreach programs and interdisciplinary workshops that are already thriving at Dartmouth College. The project's health applications will demonstrate that engineering is a human-focused occupation. This is relevant to women and minorities who, it has been suggested, avoid engineering because of its perceived disconnect with direct human concerns.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background  As the U.S. population ages and chronic diseases account for an increasing percentage of health care costs, there is a growing realization that the current supply-driven and reactive system of care is not sustainable. Empowering patients to become more proactive in managing their health is gaining recognition as a more efficient and desired reform. Advancing this reform will require biomedical devices that continuously and unobtrusively monitor individualsÆ health status, allowing for timely and customized interventions. The success of these emerging applications will rely on a special class of sensors for measuring physiological signals. In particular, these sensors will have to meet high performance specifications, but maintain a stringent power budget, even as they are kept in continuous operation.  Unfortunately, traditional approaches to sensors and sensor electronics are not well suited to high performance, always-on, ultra-low power applications. A major inefficiency of a conventional sensor is that it wastes energy on acquiring and digitizing a large amount of physical data, when only a small percentage of this data actually contains any relevant information. To address this challenge, and ultimately to realize the promise of wearable biomedical devices, this project explored a new approach to designing sensor electronics.  With this new, nonlinear dynamical systems, approach, a sensor can identify those regions of sensor data that are critical for an application's computations and state changes. Further, the sensor can adjust its parameters and resource consumption to specifically accommodate such computationally-relevant data, while discarding the remaining, less relevant data. These novel schemes have resulted in very power-efficient sensors.     Outcomes  1. Microphone sensor interface for speech applications  Intelligent audio sensors are a critical component of hearing aids, speech pattern analysis (e.g. for detecting depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and the early stages of ParkinsonÆs disease).  These applications require audio sensors that are continuously recording and analyzing sounds, constantly consuming electric power, and potentially running down the battery. To use the battery power efficiently, we researched, developed and prototyped sensor electronics that can adapt their power consumption to the instantaneous characteristics of the audio signal. Various schemes have been proposed for adapting the circuitÆs power consumption to the signalÆs dynamic range, but none of these approaches have considered bandwidth-dependent power adaptation. In most practical situations, the total bandwidth of the auditory scene does not change. Rather, the bandwidth of the audio signal of interest, e.g. speech, is in constant flux. To adapt its power consumption to the instantaneous speech bandwidth, we have developed a nonlinear scheme to reliably and efficiently detect the edges of the speech in the time-frequency (TF) plane, even in the presence of background noise.  Our bandwidth-adaptive circuit significantly reduces its power consumption while maintaining a constant dynamic range. Compared to a conventional approach, our design enjoys a 50 % power saving, without degrading the quality of speech. Also, in applications where some speech quality degradation is tolerable, we can program our circuit to trade off power consumption for speech quality. For example, our circuit can be programmed to achieve up to 84% power saving but with a perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score of 3.7 (for comparison, a global system for mobile (GSM) network in typical operating range has a PESQ score of 3.1 to 3.6).     2. Microphone sensor interface for asthma symptom monitoring  There are 1.75 million asthma-related emergency room visits per year in the US, largely due to patientsÆ poor management of their symptoms. This problem can be addressed with an automated asthma management system, which is based...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
