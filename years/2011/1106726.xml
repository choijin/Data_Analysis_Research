<AbstractNarration>Geometric group theory explores the interaction between groups and geometry.  Of central interest are geometries satisfying certain curvature conditions and the groups that act on them. This project concerns right-angled Artin groups, a class of groups that interpolates between free groups and free abelian groups.  These groups have played an increasingly important role in geometric group theory and low dimensional topology in recent years.  The action of right-angled Artin groups on cubical complexes satisfying a non- positive curvature condition, known as the CAT(0) condition, has been central to our understanding of these groups as well as to many of their applications.  Moreover, these actions serve as a rich class of examples for understanding more general CAT(0) spaces.  This project is designed to further our understanding of right-angled Artin groups, their automorphisms, and their action on cubical complexes, and to explore implications for more general CAT(0) spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is a young and exciting field that combines techniques from several areas of mathematics to give new insight into groups of symmetries of geometric objects. Symmetries play an important role throughout the sciences, particularly in chemistry, physics, and astronomy.  The goal of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of symmetry groups of a certain type of geometric object, known as a cubical complex. Cubical complexes arise in many contexts.  For example, they can be used to model robotic systems, so that mathematical properties of the geometry translate directly into physical properties of the robot.  This is a growing area of research with potential for many applications.  In addition, the PI is involved in a variety of activities designed to engage young people, particularly women, in mathematics.  Ideas from this project are being used to involve these young people in the frontier of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Differential geometry is the study of smooth manifolds with Riemannian metrics.  It underlies our understanding of many phenomena arising in physics, astrophysics, and engineering.  In the 1990Æs Mikhail Gromov showed that certain fundamental ideas from differential geometry, such as the notion of non-positive curvature, could be generalized and applied to a much broader class of geometric objects, called CAT(0) spaces.  These spaces and their symmetry groups are the focus of the first part of this project.  In particular, one can ask what happens in a CAT(0) space as one travels outward towards infinity.  In joint work with H. Sultan, we show that different "roads" (geodesic rays) to infinity can have very different characteristics and that restricting to "good" roads (rays with a contracting property), gives rise to a new type of boundary, which we call the contracting boundary.  This new boundary satisfies a variety of key properties that make it more effective than the more traditional notions of a boundary.  The second part of this project involves right-angled Artin groups, a class of groups that play a central role in the recent seminal work of Ian Agol on the structure of 3-manifolds. Geometric group theory is based on the principle that one can learn much about a group by viewing it as a group of symmetries of some nice geometric object.  Some groups arise naturally as symmetry groups, but others arise purely algebraically.  For these, one must construct an appropriate geometric object from scratch.  In this project (joint with N. Stambaugh and K. Vogtmann), we construct an explicit topological space on which the automorphism group of a right-angled Artin group acts as symmetries and we investigate the topology of this space.  An analogous construction due to Culler and Vogtmann in the 80Æs has been central to our understanding of automorphism groups of free groups.  We believe that this new space will provide an effective tool for studying this more general class of automorphism groups.  The project also provided opportunities for training graduate students and mentoring recent PhD recipients.  Three graduate students completed their PhDÆs on topics related to this project and three others are in progress.  The PI served as an organizer of a Mathematics Research Community in Geometric Group Theory, based on themes related to this project.  These workshops are aimed at building networks of graduate students and postdocs in a particular field and getting them involved in new research projects.  In addition, the PI has been involved in many activities aimed at mentoring and network-building among women studying for or starting a career in the mathematical sciences.  She served for two years as President of the Association for Women in Mathematics during which time she helped to organize two major Research Symposia and several workshops and panels aimed at early-career women.  She also helped to initiate a Women in Science program at Brandeis.                Last Modified: 08/12/2015       Submitted by: Ruth Charney]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
