<AbstractNarration>Electrophorus electricus, the strong voltage electric eel, occurs in rivers throughout South America. These fish are capable of generating strong electrical discharges of 600 volts or more, using specialized cells called electrocytes. This electrical power permits the eels to stun and kill both predators and prey. The long-term goal of this study is to create synthetic bio-batteries modeled after these electrocytes. By identifying the proteins used in nature to create, store and release an electrical potential, this project will lay the foundation for the first synthetic biological battery. This project will involve the sequencing of genomic DNA and electrocyte RNA to define the unique proteins (especially ion pumps and membrane channels and their regulators) of the electrocyte. These proteins will be purified and their electrical and regulatory properties will be studied in synthetic membranes and liposomes to define their unique and electrocyte-specific functional properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  This project can define a framework for new ways to create and manipulate biologically-derived electrical energy, and could thus have substantial impacts in energy research and production. The investigator and the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center's outreach staff will use the electric eels and their electrocytes to help in educating and communicating to the public basic knowledge of how biological organisms create and use electrical energy. A team of undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will develop a synthetic biology bio-energy project using genetic toolkits, including one from the electric eel, and will compete in the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition for undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>
