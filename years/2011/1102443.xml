<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The researcher at a university laboratory, the doctor at a regional clinic, the faculty member at a community college, and the  middle-school student in a public library all increasingly rely on the Internet to work, learn, and collaborate with colleagues across their cities and states, and on the other side of the country. Broadband Internet is critical to industrial innovation, access to education, and cost-effective health care. Yet the United States, which led the development of the Internet, recently ranked 14th among developed countries in the deployment of broadband.   Advanced regional and state networks (ARNs) are uniquely positioned to realize AmericaÆs broadband future and the national priorities that depend on it. Over the past 25 years, ARNs have played a critical role in the deployment of the Internet within the United States and the development of the global Internet itself. Beyond commercially available network services, ARNs link institutions within the region they serve, and connect their regions to the national ecosystem of advanced research and education (R&amp;E) networks. They provide leading-edge network services and, as importantly, are hubs for diffusing technical expertise and experience across the communities they serve.   Today, ARNs are expanding to serve entirely new sets of organizations, but are finding that they must adapt to do so. In fact, we are now at an inflection point unlike any other in the forty-year history of R&amp;E networking, with ARNs facing an intersection of increasing opportunities and rising challenges. To realize their full potential, ARNs must reach a common vision for their future development, fundamentally reevaluating core issues such as funding, form, and function.   In this reassessment, ARNs will need to draw on their position as trusted, neutral centers of resources, experience, and expertise. They must serve an expanding community of communities while retaining their historic connection to leading edge research. ARNs must adapt to often rapidly changing business and policy environments, as well as shifting expectations and demands from users. They must continue to offer the high-performance networking services that fall within their historical remit and at the same time extend their offerings to encompass new capabilities such as mobile networking and cloud computing.   In this context, a recent workshop supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) gathered leading experts with vast experience in the development and operation of ARNs, as well as leaders from the national R&amp;E networking community and industry.  Over two days, workshop participants considered issues such as new technologies and services, financial models, organizational structure, and operating models. They weighed challenges and opportunities, as well as potential responses. The resultant white paper sets forth a synthesis of those discussions and proposes a possible way forward.   A core theme that emerged at this workshop was the elimination of the network as a bottleneck for continued progress in many arenas - scientific research, education, health care delivery, and entertainment.  Joined by a shared vision, ARNs are poised to provide a  foundation for the future of our nationÆs network-driven innovation, scientific progress, and economic growth.  This workshop was held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in October 2010.  Principal support was provided by the National Science Foundation Office of Cyberinfrastructure through grant OCI-1102443.  Additional support was provided by MCNC (the ARN for North Carolina), the Utah Education Network (UEN), and the University of Utah.  Two principal work products emerged from this workshop - a compilation of contributed position papers written by the invited participants and a summary white paper.  Both of these documents are generally available at the workshop web site:  https://www.mcnc.org/arn-envision-meeting          Last Modified: 0...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
