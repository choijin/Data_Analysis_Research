<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Rochester.   The objective of this site  is to offer undergraduate students nationwide the opportunity to take part in forefront physics research in eight subfields: particle and nuclear physics, quantum optics, condensed matter, biological, plasma, astrophysics, geo- and environmental physics, and physics education.  Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus of the group. The program may include minicourses in machining, Linux/Unix, MATLAB and a GRE preparation course offered in conjunction with  other summer undergraduate programs. REU students attend weekly presentations by University faculty, tours of University research facilities, social outings and may also take part in the department's summer outreach activities. The program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research project; in addition students submit written abstracts and reports of their research experiences.  Students are strongly encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present their results at national student and professional conferences. REU activities engage undergraduates in projects such as physical chemistry, cosmic ray and high-energy particle detection, and geo- and astrophysics data analysis using web-based databases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the REU Site in Physics and Astrophysics at the  University of Rochester is to offer undergraduate students nationwide  the opportunity to take part in forefront physics research in eight  subfields: particle and nuclear physics, quantum optics, condensed  matter, biological, plasma, astrophysics, geo- and environmental  physics. The REU program has shown success  in the participation of women, a highly underrepresented group in  physics, and serves a significant number of students from non-research  institutions each year.  A range of recruitment strategies for minority  students is in place both at the department and at the institutional  level.  Stipend support and on-site housing are available for all  participants.  Each student works with a faculty adviser on a specific  project within the context of the overall research focus of the group.  The program has included a mini-course in Linux/Unix, and  MATLAB.  REU students attend weekly presentations by University  faculty, tours of University research facilities, social outings, and  may also take part in the departmentÆs summer outreach activities.  The  program concludes with a student symposium, at which each student speaks  on his/her research project; students submit written abstracts and  reports of their research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged  to continue their projects toward publication and are eligible for  additional support to present their results at national student and  professional conferences. REU activities engage undergraduates in  projects such as physical chemistry, cosmic ray and high-energy particle  detection, optics, and geo- and astrophysics data analysis using web-based  databases.  Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of the  program is demonstrated by the strong record of publications, conference  presentations, and awards among REU participants.  Many of the research  projects in which students have participated are attracting growing  interest from the scientific community.  The facultyÆs research groupÆs  combination of enthusiasm and discipline motivates students and  contributes to the quality of their research.  Individual guidance and  mentoring fosters each studentÆs skill at navigating the world of  science - giving talks, writing articles - and as well as his or her  intellectual development as an independent researcher.   Broader impacts:  The further benefit of the REU  programÆs "culture of mentoring" comes in retaining undergraduates in  physical sciences and instilling in them the desire and skill to mentor  others.  The program clearly contributes to the goal of building the  nationÆs scientific workforce and leadership. Many of the REU  participants cite the program as pivotal in their decision to follow a  research career.  The  REU program demonstrates the possibility and potential of responding to  societal concerns and at the same time producing excellent science.
