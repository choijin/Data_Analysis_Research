<AbstractNarration>This award provides NSF support to continue an experiment that utilizes the very large population of STEM professionals in New Mexico (third per capita among all states) to help improve K-14 math and science education in the Santa Fe area, and to raise the profile of math and science in the community. This experiment, a partnership between the Santa Fe Alliance for Science (SFAFS) and the Santa Fe Public Schools (SFPS), began in May, 2005. In 2010, the partnership was extended to include Santa Fe Community College (SFCC), and in 2011 the University of New Mexico (Department of Physics and Astronomy) became the managing partner.  The essential questions that this experiment seeks to answer are: (1) How can this resource of STEM professionals be utilized to make effective change happen? (2) How can this group of highly trained content experts in math and science be molded into an effective pedagogical entity? (3) How can existing educational modalities be modified, or reshaped, to take advantage of this talent pool? (4) How can these specially skilled individuals help create greater student and public interest in the beauty, power and value of math and science, and bring these ideas to all segments of our community? (5) How can the social and political issues that will certainly arise be dealt with most effectively? SFAFS's broad goal is to help K-14 students succeed in math and science so that they have the skills necessary to choose from a variety of careers. SFAFS has built an effort that brings greatly enriched math and science content to a large number of students, parents and teachers in Santa Fe. Thus the enormous math and science content knowledge accumulated by SFAFS volunteers during their careers has a rewarding "second life" as a knowledge base and inspiration for a widely diverse demographic of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Santa Fe Alliance For Science (SFAFS) is a non-profit volunteer organization that utilizes the very large population of STEM professionals in New Mexico (third per capita among all states) to help improve K-14 math and science education in the Santa Fe area and to raise the profile of math and science in our community.  New MexicoÆs students have persistently ranked very poorly in academic performance compared to other states, especially in K-12 math and science.  Closely related to this is the fact that New Mexico ranks 49th among the states in the number of students living in households with incomes below the federal poverty line.  These facts imperil the economic future of New Mexico.  Our goal is to help improve this situation.  The essential questions posed in this proposal were: (1) How can this resource of volunteer STEM professionals be utilized to make effective change happen? (2) How can this group of highly-trained math and science experts be molded into an effective pedagogical entity? (3) How can existing educational modalities be modified, or reshaped, to take advantage of this talent pool? (4) How can these specially skilled individuals help create greater student and public interest in the beauty, power and value of math and science, and bring these ideas to all segments of our community? (5) How can the social and political issues that will certainly arise be dealt with most effectively? The answers to these questions form the "intellectual merit" of this proposal (NSF Proposal Criterion 1).   During this grant period we have shown that effective ways of utilizing this powerful resource to answer these questions are well in hand.  An independent assessment (by Kaser and Associates) of our program confirmed this for the most part.  These modalities are based on our strong partnerships with Santa Fe Public Schools (SFPS), the Santa Fe Community College (SFCC) and a number of independent (e.g. charter) schools.  They include extensive programs in (1) math and science tutoring and mentoring, (2) science fair advising and judging, (3) student discussions of frontier science topics (the "Santa Fe Science Caf&eacute;s for Young Thinkers" series), and (4) a Saturday morning series of Professional Enrichment presentations for (mostly) high school math and science teachers.   During its nearly ten-year existence, and particularly over the period of this grant, SFAFS has positively impacted several thousand K-14 students and teachers, 75% of whom are Hispanic. It has also interacted substantively with the Santa Fe Indian School.  During the 2013-14 academic year, our tutoring program experienced about 2130 student interactions at SFCC and all district high schools.  Data for 2014-15 are not available because the academic year has not concluded. Since inception in 2007, the science fair program has achieved dramatic results. In 2014-15, SFAFS judged about 2760 projects, a 350% increase since 2007-8.  This year, 26 schools had a science fair, up from nine in 2007-8. Science fairs are now a vital part of the science program at most schools in Santa Fe, including a major fair at the Santa Fe Indian School. Beginning in 2013, weÆve established a "pre-fair" program of visits by SFAFS volunteers to many of the schools to provide help and coaching to students and teachers about what it means to do a science experiment.  Production of a training video is in progress. Our Science Caf&eacute; series (54 since 2006, six per year) has presented exciting frontier STEM topics to an average attendance of 65 students (and often parents).  In 2013 and 2014-15, the Professional Enrichment program focused on science topics (e.g. energy and the environment, and development of the human brain) that could be useful to curricular development.  For all these reasons SFAFS efforts have been enthusiastically received by school administrators, teachers, students and parents.
