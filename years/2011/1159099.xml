<AbstractNarration>The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a 24-month fellowship for Dr. Christopher Pappas from Manhattanville College located in Purchase, New York, to work with Dr. Mathieu Picardeau within the Biology of Spirochetes Unit at the Institut Pasteur located in Paris, France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To aid in the physiologic study of the genus Leptospira, the investigators are developing an inducible system which will be used to engineer conditional mutants of essential genes in Leptospira spp..  Further, the investigators are exploring in detail the phenotypes of previously identified transposon mutants created using the Himar1 mariner transposon system which has previously been developed within the host laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by the genus Leptospira.  It is a zoonotic infection which is maintained within a mammalian reservoir.  Transmission to humans can lead to severe disease manifestations, which results in fatality in over 10% of cases worldwide.  The proposed projects will aid in the characterization of the physiological aspects of Leptospira spp. and thus allow greater understanding of the biology of leptospires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further, this fellowship aids the study of leptospires to transcend national borders.  The fellowship creates an international collaboration between Dr. Christopher Pappas of Manhattanville College and Dr. Mathieu Picardeau and other colleagues at the Institut Pasteur; a facility focused on the advancement of biological sciences and public health comprised of researchers who collaborate at the international level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dr. Christopher Pappas completed a 24 month international postdoctoral fellowship funded by the National Science FoundationÆs International Research Fellowship Program.  The project was titled "IRFP: Characterizing the Function of Leptospiral Proteins in the Biology of the Genus Leptospira".  Pathogenic strains of Leptospira are responsible for the global zoonotic disease leptospirosis, of which there are approximately one million cases annually with fatality ocurring in 5-20% of all cases.  Dr. Pappas conducted research within the laboratory of Dr. Mathieu Picardeau at the Institut Pasteur located in Paris, France.  The principle objectives of this fellowship were to increase our understanding of the biology of Leptospira and to develop novel genetic manipulation tools for Leptospira spp..   Dr. PappasÆ fellowship accomplished the research objectives through various approaches.  For example, Dr. Pappas worked with Dr. Picardeau and other collaborators to develop  new technology that allows researchers to more easily manipulate the bacteria at the genetic level.  One of these new technologies was the development of a plasmid which was named pMaORI.  This technology allows researchers to insert genes into the Leptospira cell without having to insert the genes directly into its genome.  This  will aid future researchers when studying how the bacteria functions.  Another project allowed Dr. Pappas to work with international collaborators in the U.S., France, and China to study a gene that translates into a protein that binds directly to DNA.  It is predicted that this protein plays a role in helping the bacteria to adapt to different environments it is exposed to (such as when moving from water to a mammalian host) through a process called gene regulation.   The results of Dr. PappasÆ research have been disseminated to make the findings readily available to other researchers and the public.  These communications include presentations at international conferences, manuscripts in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and an invited talk to a general audience at a U.S. college.  In addition, the technology developed (pMaORI) has been made made freely available to other research laboratories.  In addition to its scientific merit, the fellowship provided Dr. Pappas with an opportunity that has had a significant impact on his career and future research.  For example, the fellowship provided Dr. Pappas with an excellent mentor.  Dr. Picardeau has based his career on Leptospira spp. research, and has been at the forefront of the development of genetic manipulation tools for use in Leptospira.  Concordantly, Dr. Pappas was able to develop Leptospira-specific research skills that will be of direct benefit to conducting Leptospira-based research in the United States.  The fellowship also allowed Dr. Pappas to establish an international network of colleagues.  This network will allow Dr. Pappas to work with collaborators on future projects who can provide him with valuable feedback while he establishes his Leptospira spp. research program.  Beyond his own training and professional development, Dr. Pappas had the opportunity to positively influence other young researchers within Dr. PicardeauÆs laboratory.  For example, in certain instances, graduate students were given technical advice on project design, feedback and instruction on methods to improve presentation skills, career advice, review of written materials, and assistance with research projects.  Collectively, the fellowship has allowed Dr. Pappas to develop into a more capable and independent Leptospira spp. researcher.  Dr. Pappas intends to make this knowledge of public benefit by establishing a Leptospira spp. research program at a U.S. based undergraduate institution; where he also intends to educate undergraduates and include them in this research to encourage them to pursue a science-based career.  In conclusion, the funding of this fellowship has made an important contribution t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
