<AbstractNarration>The Space Weather Workshop is an annual conference that brings industry, academia, and government agencies together in a lively dialog about space weather. This workshop has evolved into the Nation's leading conference on all issues relating to space weather. The intellectual merit of the activity is critical to the advancement of knowledge, understanding and needs of the space weather research community. The workshop addresses the diverse impacts of space weather on today's technology. The program highlights space weather impacts in several areas, including communications, navigations, spacecraft operations, aviation, and electric power. The presentations and discussions at the Space Weather Workshop also focus on identifying the highest priority needs for operational services that can guide future research and identifying new high-value capabilities that can be transitioned into operations. The conference fosters communication among researchers, space weather service providers, and users of space weather services. The workshop will help develop mechanisms to generate actionable information to drive improved space weather science, products, services and application to serve a broad user community. The workshop also fosters coordinated interagency approaches to space weather education and outreach that will lead to better informed policy and decision makers yielding more support for research, operational improvements, and better service to the Nation.</AbstractNarration>

Last Modified: 10/15/2012       Submitted by: Meg Austin The Space Weather Workshop included plenary sessions, poster sessions and a roundtable discussion about growing the space weather enterprise. Plenary sessions addressed the following topics: 1. Ionospheric impacts of space weather 2. Geomagnetically induced currents 3. Aviation and space weather 4. Satellite issues 5. Agency activities 6. Space weather enterprise: mapping the future 7. International coordination of space weather activities 8. Space weather prediction modeling  9. Satellite observations  10. Solar cycle and long term trends in space weather   Poster sessions focused on the following topics: 1. Ionosphere and thermosphere research and applications 2.

Keynote speakers included Dr. Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Jr., Vice President, Science Programs, CSC, and former NOAA Administrator, and Dr. P&aring;l Brekke of the Norwegian Space Centre.  The complete 2011 Space Weather Workshop agenda, including all of the presentations given, can be found at: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/sww/sww11/Schedule_w_presentations_2011.html The workshop is important because it brings together the space weather community to share information among researchers, service-provider agencies, private-sector service providers, international organizations, space weather information users, and government agencies. The program contributes to improving knowledge about space weather impacts in several areas, including communications, navigations, spacecraft operations, aviation, and electric power.
