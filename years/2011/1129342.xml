<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to investigate the effect of informal, out-of-school learning activities on students' decisions to attend engineering degree programs.  The study builds on the success of the "Design Squad" TV series that engages many middle-school aged youth.  The study uses survey methods as well as interviews to collect data which will be analyzed using social cognitive career theory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to increase understanding of how informal educational activities influence students' choices in college majors and thus their ultimate career choices.  The research focuses specifically on young women who are a group generally under-represented in engineering degree programs.  The project builds on strong partnerships with many other youth organizations such as the Girl Scouts of the USA.  This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise.  Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>

Our main research question was: How do informal engineering programs (such as Design Squad, a WGBH multimedia informal engineering program for middle school-aged children) support engineering-related learning over time (i.e., engineering pathways)?    To answer our research questions, we embarked on a qualitative study in which we followed a sample of 60 middle school children in Massachusetts and Indiana over a period of three academic years (6th grade through 8th grade). While our study focused on middle school children, we also gathered data from their parents and educators (informal and formal) to garner additional perspectives on the childrenÆs experiences.   The IPE study investigated the effect of informal, out-of-school activities, as well as other factors (self-efficacy, outcome expectations, personal interests, and intrapersonal factors) on childrenÆs interest in engineering and decisions to engage in engineering-related activities. At the beginning, middle, and end of the study, we independently interviewed the middle school-aged child and one or more of his/her parents. During the initial interview with the children, we also asked the parents to complete the modified "Parent Engineering Awareness Survey."

To complement the interviews with the children and parents, we also interviewed informal educators, teachers, and school principals.

The IPE study found that the opportunities for middle school childrenÆs participation in engineering activities, either in school or outside of school, vary widely in terms of their availability or quality.

The following is a summary of our findings:    Parents had a very strong influence over whether children stayed on what the project team called a 'direct engineering pathway'. Peers, especially negative peer pressure, appeared to be a key factor in derailing middle school children's interest in engineering pathways. The transition from 7th to 8th grade seemed to be a pivotal time in terms of engineering pathway development/interests. Being involved in a minimum of 5-7 engineering activities each year seemed to support a child's interest in engineering. 'Direct Pathway' children, who exhibited a significantly higher level of engineering-related outcomes and better attitudes toward engineering, tended to have mother's with STEM degrees and came from households with annual incomes over $75,000; the majority (6 out of 8) were from Indiana; were girls (5 out of 8); were white (6 out of 8); and attended public schools (6 out of 8). Children with the highest interest in engineering foundations (STEM subjects) tended to be girls, go to public schools, and have mothers with STEM degrees; knowing an engineer also contributed to an on-going interest in engineering. Children who described themselves as being good at math and science also reported enjoying STEM-related activities. Enjoyment of STEM activities also...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
