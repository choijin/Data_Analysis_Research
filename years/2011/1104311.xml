<AbstractNarration>Hartnell College is creating 2+2+2 career pathways for technicians, engineers, and engineering designers in two emerging fields of sustainable energy, power engineering and engineering design. The goals of the project are to (1) improve the STEM pipeline from two area high schools to Hartnell College and to the University of California at Santa Cruz, (2) integrate renewable energy technologies into existing curricula at participating high schools and Hartnell, and (3) prepare students to work in sustainable energy and engineering technologies jobs. The project is forming a consortium of at least 10 partners, including industry, in sustainable energy education; creating and supporting new energy career pathways; increasing student enrollment in high school and bridge program sustainable energy programs; developing and implementing an internship program; and using a newly constructed sustainable energy and research facility. Project deliverables include new courses, research findings from student projects, a model consortium, high school outreach and instructional materials, and project evaluation data.</AbstractNarration>

With full time Engineering and Sustainable Design faculty, 6300 square feet of new labs and classrooms at Hartnell CollegeÆs Center for Advanced Technology available for student education, engineering research, sustainable design and green construction, a micro-grid test facility, and a well developed Consortium of regional schools, industry, government agencies and nonprofits, Hartnell College is well positioned for continued growth in student success including STEM areas.      The Salinas Valley Consortium for Sustainable Energy, Education, and Research was initiated in 2011 to develop educational pathways in Engineering and Sustainable Design. These education tracks were designed to serve the needs of a largely agricultural based, 80% Latino, immigrant population living in the Salinas Valley.       Led by Hartnell Community College Engineering, Sustainable Design, and Construction programs, and in collaboration with UCSC Engineering, the Consortium expanded to include nine colleges and universities and twelve high schools.  Other partners included Chevron Energy Systems, Pacific Gas and Electric, Applied Solar Systems, Hayward Building Materials, local government agencies, and nonprofits.       Over 3 summers, in a collaboration between Hartnell College and UCSCÆs Engineering Program, 52 students including 32 community college and 20 high school students participated in 8-week renewable energy research projects.

Student projects were presented at Hartnell CollegeÆs Annual STEM Symposium.       In 2014, 3 community college mentors and 13 Salinas high school interns completed an 8-week research internship program designed to introduce engineering principles to students while building a Tiny House. The goal was to create greater interest in Engineering programs.  25% of the students indicated increased interest in pursuing an education in Engineering.       Interns also participated in conferences and competitions.  In 2013 two Hartnell College student interns were selected to present their research regarding their model off-the-grid, self-sustaining "Pocket House" at the annual ATE conference in Washington D.C.  Additionally, in 2014, a Hartnell team became the first community college to win the International Mock Firm Skyscraper Design Competition.       To develop the educational paths in Engineering and Sustainable Design, Hartnell College hired its first full-time faculty in Engineering and in Sustainable Design and Construction in 2011. In addition, 5 Project Lead the Way educational programs were arranged for local high school faculty between 2012 and 2014. An agreement between UCSC and Hartnell College in 2011 introduced new Renewable Energy curriculum to not only the Engineering Program at Hartnell College, but also to Consortium partners Cabrillo  and Foothill Community Colleges. In 2012 an articulation agreement was completed between the Salinas High School Sustainable Construction Academy and the Hartnell College Sustainable Design and Construction program.  A new Associates degree was developed by Hartnell College in 2012 and approved by the California ChancellorÆs office as the first community ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
