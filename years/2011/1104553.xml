<AbstractNarration>This project is a research in algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematical science. The Principal Investigator (PI) will study properties of certain spaces (called moduli space) of objects that can be characterized by algebraic properties. (An example of such are the roots of polynomials). These spaces describe solution spaces that are vital to research in many branches of mathematical researches and in theoretical physics. The PI will work on several research directions. He will work toward a full understanding of high genus Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds; he will also develop an alternative theory on generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants of Calabi-Yau threefold; develop necessarily tools to study and prove the conjecture on BPS-states of Calabi-Yau threefolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is the continuation of PI's long term research goal of broadening mathematical research by understanding new idea from theoretical physics and contributing to the development of theoretical physics by providing mathematical foundation vital to its advancement. The progress on studying high genus GW invariants and DT invariants will advance our understanding of moduli spaces in general; enrich the research in algebraic geometry. It will also strengthen the interaction between algebraic geometry and other subjects of mathematics, and with mathematical physics. This project will promote teaching, learning and training young mathematical researchers. Over all, it will contribute its share in advancing the science research in the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[            This is a research project investigating several central problems in a core subject in theoretical mathematics: the subject moduli problems in algebraic geometry; the problems investigated in this project are that influenced by mathematical physics.             The discovery of gauge theory in mathematical physics influenced tremendously the study of bundles and connections in mathematics, and since the revolutionary work in early 80’s, this influence has expanded to algebraic geometry, on moduli of stable bundles over algebraic surfaces, and later over Calabi-Yau threefolds. One goal of this project is to study the gauge theory in algebraic geometry. For this part, the PI and his collaborators has made two breakthroughs in this direction:  use Kirwan blowing up to construct Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a Calabi-Yau threefold associated with moduli spaces of sheaves when strictly semistable sheaves are present; constructed a categorification of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, which is to construct a class of perverse sheaves of the moduli of stable sheaves on Calabi-Yau threefolds with specific properties.    Along the way, the PI constructed a polarized MHM structure so that its underlying perverse sheaf is the perverse sheaf constructed on the moduli of dimension one sheaes on a Calabi-Yau threefold, which allowed him to define an analogue of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants.             Since 80’s, mathematical physicists have discovered a set of new invariants, called Gromov-Witten invariants in mathematics, which is an "ideal" counting of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds, a part of the "Mirror Symmetry". This inspired a new subject in mathematics. One goal of this project is to prove mathematically several key structural conjectures on the Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds. In this project, the PI and his collaborators began a new approach, inspired by a proposal of the leading mathematical physicist Witten, and made several breakthrough under the support of this project, that eventually led him to a proof of two major conjectures on the structure of all genus GW invariants of quintics Calabi-Yau threefolds: the YY polynomiality conjecture and BCOV Feynman sum conjecture of the GW invariants of quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds. The progress made under the support of this project are:  developed a theory of Witten top Chern class and FJRW invariants using cosection localized virtual classes; introduced the notion of Mixed-Spin-P fields, constructed their moduli spaces, and defined a field theory based on such moduli spaces; proved a class of vanishings, essential for the applications of this theory; obtained a class of vanishing, which gives polynomial relations among GW invariants of quintic Calabi-Yau threefolds, and of FJRW invariants of Fermat quintics.    This set the mathematical foundation for the study of the two major conjectures mentioned, ciompleted the initial phase of the project to prove the structural conjectures of all genus GW invariants of quintics Calabi-Yau threefolds.             This research project has provided opportunity for developing training project for PI’s three PhD students. The research outcomes have or will appear in research mathematical journals. Before their publications, all of them have been diseminated at the open internet site arxiv.org.       Last Modified: 01/29/2020       Submitted by: Jun Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
