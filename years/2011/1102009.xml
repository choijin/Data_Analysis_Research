<AbstractNarration>The solar wind is the primary driver for space weather phenomena at the Earth.  Unfortunately, the observations of the solar wind are plagued by gaps in the data.  Modeling of the dynamics of the magnetosphere and ionosphere generally require time-continuous information about the solar wind density, velocity and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).  This project will utilize singular spectrum analysis (SSA) techniques to fill in the gaps in the solar wind data by using data from a variety of ground-based observations where continuous data are available.  The SSA analysis will be applied to the historical solar wind data from 1963 to the present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting dataset will be used for studies of the radiaton belts.  The dataset will also be made available to the research community through the Virtual Radiation Belt Observatory (ViRBO).  The continuous solar wind and IMF data that will be produced will be useful in a variety of research projects concerning space weather and the work therefore will have societal benefits.  The project also has educational benefits through the participation of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The main historical &mdash; i.e., pre-1994 &mdash; solar-wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) observations come from measurements taken on board of the IMP-8 spacecraft. While the spacecraft crossed the magnetosheath and magnetosphere, it was not immersed in the solar wind at all times, and so large continuous gaps exist in the collected data. Even after 1994 there have been many data gaps in the solar wind data, though they are not as frequent and are usually shorter.       The behavior of EarthÆs magnetosphere is strongly influenced by the solar wind. Various geomagnetic indices &mdash; such as Kp, Dst or AE &mdash;are inferred from ground-measured, and hence time-lagged magnetic disturbances that are caused by the magnetosphereÆs interaction with the solar wind and the embedded IMF; these indices are inferred from the ground and are typically available continuously in time, even when solar-wind data are not. Broadly speaking, these indices can be considered as a proxy for the overall time-lagged magnetospheric response to the solar driver, i.e., to the solar wind parameters and IMF.       This project reconstructed the data in the gaps of the solar wind parameters  by using smooth spatio-temporal modes of co-variability inferred by singular spectrum analysis (SSA) from time-lagged correlations in multivariate data consisting of gappy-driver (solar wind and IMF) and continuous-response records (various geomagnetic indices),&mdash; while discarding the noise . We used historical satellite data of solar wind and IMF measurements (1972&ndash;current) data at OMNIWEB database (http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov). The OMNIWEB data set combines solar wind observations taken by different spacecraft, specifically by IMP-8, WIND, and ACE spacecraft.  Dataset for reconstructed solar wind parameters has been made available via personal website of lead PI (http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/tcd/dkondras/SolarWind.html),  as well as ViRBO (Virtual Radiation Belt Observatory)  data depository (http://virbo.org/OMNI/OMNI2#Notes).      New research capabilities with filled-in solar wind dataset has been demonstrated by applications for empirical models of global magentospheric magnetic field and radiation belts data assimilation and statistical studies.
