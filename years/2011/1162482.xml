<AbstractNarration>Disasters create social disruption.  As a result, everyday lives change severely.  The amount of social disruption reflects the degree an event is a disaster.  One way to capture the amount of social disruption is through the use of cell phone data.  Normal, everyday cell phone use will be compared to disaster and post disaster use. As a result, it may be explained how much social disruption occurs from the disaster.  Also, the process and speed an area returns to "normal (i.e., the pre-disaster patterns)" may be seen.  Two recent, but different disasters (e.g., scope of area, speed of onset), will be selected for this study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project?s unique approach uses the expertise of a civil engineer, sociologist, and a computer scientist.  Math, computer science and travel behavior research will be combined to understand disasters.  This project will improve how we understand social disruption as a disaster.  It will also show how indirect measures can be used to study these events.  Also, it will lay the foundation for using other measures to capture the idea of "social disruption." This project will also suggest that emergency managers can use these types of data to improve their emergency management capabilities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research project has successfully used social media data (1) to classify between normal and abnormal scenarios, where an abnormal scenario is one in which an abnormal event occurs and causes disruption in normal routine; (2) to calculate and compare level of regularity between normal and abnormal scenarios; and (3) to infer individuals&rsquo; spatio-temporal profiles by automatically detecting their travel modes and trip purposes. In particular, our New Jersey Institute of Technology team, in collaboration with University of Washington at Seattle team and Oklahoma State University team, has accomplished the following research tasks, i.e., development of Sliding-window, Distance and Similarity (SDS)-based and learning/optimization method for area-level anomaly detection and evolution analysis of disasters via the Twitter dataset collected by University of Washington at Seattle team. The Twitter data collected around a hurricane named Sandy that occurred in 2012 is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed concepts and methods. The results show that our methods can precisely predicate the accurate evolution of the hurricane, i.e., the affected place, time and severity. Various learning, clustering and optimization algorithms are developed and their applications to other scientific areas are explored. The project results have been well disseminated though many journal papers, many conference papers and presentation, and several seminars that are related to this project&rsquo;s research results. A number of graduate students including minority and female ones are cultivated and trained by conducting their research in the subject areas of this highly inter-disciplinary research project.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/05/2016<br>      Modified by: Mengchu&nbsp;Zhou</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1162482/1162482_10163197_1467411598703_ScreenShot2016-07-01at6.19.03PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1162482/1162482_10163197_1467411598703_ScreenShot2016-07-01at6.19.03PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hurricane Sandy impacted pattern with identifiers."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1162482/1162482_10163197_1467411598703_ScreenShot2016-07-01at6.19.03PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hurricane Sandy impacted pattern with identifiers."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Each integer represents a spatial cluster.</div> <div class="imageCredit">NJIT</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mengchu&nbsp;Zhou</div> <div class="imageTitle">Hurricane Sandy impacted pattern with identifiers.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1162482/1162482_10163197_1467411771865_ScreenShot2016-07-01at6.21.40PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1162482/1162482_10163197_1467411771865_ScreenShot2016-07-01at6.21.40PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hurricane Sandy impacted pattern with disaster-related ratio."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1162482/1162482_10163197_1467411771865_ScreenShot2016-07-01at6.21.40PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hurricane Sandy impacted pattern with disaster-related ratio."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Each numerical number indicates disaster-related ratio.</div> <div class="imageCredit">NJIT</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mengchu&nbsp;Zhou</div> <div class="imageTitle">Hurricane Sandy impacted pattern with disa...]]></DRECONTENT>
