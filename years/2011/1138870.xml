<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for The ?Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions? conference (26-29 March 2012, London) being developed by the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) in conjunction with the International Council for Sciences international global environmental change research partners.  Building on a comprehensive update of our current knowledge of the Earth system and the pressure it is under, the conference will present and debate new insights into potential opportunities and constraints for innovative development pathways based on novel partnerships.  The conference will focus on three broad themes which are critical to the scientific and societal challenges surrounding global sustainability.  These themes are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Meeting global needs: food, energy, water and other ecosystem services; &lt;br/&gt;2. Transforming our way of living: development pathways under global environmental change; and&lt;br/&gt;3. Governing across scales: innovative stewardship of the Earth system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will provide a critical step toward reaching solutions to these challenges and will provide a venue to highlight the current state of our planet prior to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in June of 2012.  The conference will bring together 2,500 global change experts from around the world in a discussion of the current status of, future predictions for and potential solutions to the issue of global change as it relates to human and environmental sustainability.  The synthesis of ideas generated at the conference will advance our collective understanding of the pressures on our planet and what steps need to be taken to alleviate these pressures while maintaining and promoting quality of life. The conference will provide a venue for early career and developing country scientists and students to forge new international networks and partnerships to better understand and overcome the issues involved in providing pathways for a sustainable planet.  A major component of the conference will be stakeholder engagement through plenary talks, technical sessions, workshops and seminars.  In addition, the conference will include strong policy and science interactions through these mechanisms and strong public engagement through webcasts and interactive media.</AbstractNarration>

Major editorials in high-profile scientific      journals Nature and Science.   The goals of Planet Under Pressure were to:  Strengthen and build the global-change research community,      in particular form closer links between natural and social science.  Spearhead a new direction for international      research focusing on global sustainability.  Reach out to a broader community &ndash; the      development community, policy, industry, media, and public.  The conference was timed to contribute to the      UNÆs Rio+20 Summit, the largest summit in UN history (June 2012). The UN      recognized the conference as part of the official preparations for the UN      summit.       The NSF grant facilitated an ambitious and often experimental international engagement strategy targeting key stakeholders:  International scientific community International development community Policy makers Media Public Business and industry   Planet Under Pressure attracted over 3000 participants plus an additional 3000 online, including world-leading experts on climate, global change, global sustainability, development, policy, economics and many other disciplines.  The conference brought together social and natural sciences and has made significant progress in creating the foundation for the new community for Future Earth: research for global sustainability.   Beyond this, funding from NSF provided major financial support primarily for the wide range of engagement efforts that greatly enhanced the global reach and success of the conference.  UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon addressed the conference on the High-Level policy day via recorded video. The conference, helped inform Ban Ki-moonÆs Global Sustainability Panel report, Resilient People, Resilient Planet, and became a major landmark on the road to Rio+20. Indeed, IGBP secretariat staff are acknowledged in the Secretary GeneralÆs report.
