<AbstractNarration>Computer performance has doubled many times over during the past 40 years, but the very techniques used to achieve these performance gains have made it increasingly difficult to build systems that are provably safe, secure, or reliable. This fact significantly impedes progress in the development of our most safety-critical embedded systems such as those found in medical, avionic, automotive, and military systems.  A transformation in the way that these systems are created is needed, one that uses new hardware design techniques, computer architectures, and programming languages to create classes of hardware/software systems with formal and provable safety properties that are verifiable all the way down to the implementation level of bits and logic gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will change the way that hardware and embedded systems designers approach the problem of provable properties, enabling them to directly control and analyze the system at the lowest level and to statically determine if their designs are in compliance with a given policy.  For example, if a system must be real-time this property can be verifiable for a full system, from gates to software, by ensuring that the architecture design carefully manages interference through a set of new hardware primitives, software designed to exploit these new primitives, specialized hardware analysis tools, and new design languages.  To ensure this technology will have impact beyond academia the PIs are making these new technologies available and accessible through easy to use tools, continuing to include undergraduates at all levels of research to help train a new generation of engineers capable of designing safety-critical systems, and integrating concepts from information assurance into their extensive outreach activities.  Over the long term this research will help create the skills and tools that embedded system engineers need to evaluate the trustworthiness of their systems, and it will ease the development of those critical systems on which we all depend on for our safety and livelihood.</AbstractNarration>

As our society become even more dependent on computing for everything from finance, to voting, to defense, a sound foundation on which to build these trusted systems is more important now than ever before.  Of course security is not a single "thing".  Security is, in part, a set of properties one would like a system to have.  While these have technical names, such as determinism, fault tolerance, real-time guarantees, and secure information flow, at the end of the day they call come down to the computer system doing only what is need to get the job done.  Security is a pervasive topic that spans across all aspects of computer system design. This ranges from topics related to protecting individual privacy (e.g., ensuring that sensitive data is properly encrypted) to making computing systems resilient and available. The latter is particularly important in our nation?s critical infrastructure including transportation (automobiles, planes), power delivery (SCADA systems, electrical grid), medical (pace makers, hospital record systems), and Internet (server farms, laptops).  The research carried out demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to build systems with complex security properties in a way that it can be proven mathematically that they hold.
