<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator proposes to gather information about the scientific research, unique biology and&lt;br/&gt;evidence of a changing climate occurring on the Antarctic Peninsula. Actin during her voyage to the Antarctic as an "expedition artist," simialr to those who were carried by early explorers, the PI will closely observe the climate, landscape, oceanography and ecology to gain first-hand knowledge about the region. She will also interact with scientists in the lab and on field studies to learn about their research and its importance to human understanding of the world and climate change. The artist will make detailed documentations of her discoveries using daily log entries, drawings, photographs, small copperplate engravings, audiofield recordings and interviews with scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pi will use use the information gatheeed in the field as the basis for a series of cameo-glass engravings. The PI's medium is a traditional technique of carving away layers of glass to make a&lt;br/&gt;relief engraving. The engravings will aim to capture the essence of the region and the research being carried out for the purpose of educating a wide public about Antarctica and the continent?s importance to global welfare. Some of the engravings will be large, wall mounted panel works and other pieces will be carved glass objects shown in wood and glass display cabinets. A catalog compiling the artist?s field studies and notes will accompany the exhibition. The Pi will also teach workshops to Seattle-area high school students. and run a similar program with youth in the summer arts program of the Service Board, a non-profit organization that mentors under-represented youth of South Seattle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
