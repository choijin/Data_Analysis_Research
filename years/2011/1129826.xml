<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for characterizing and manipulating the adhesive properties of graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed into a honeycomb lattice that have been shown to have extraordinary mechanical, optical, thermal and electronic properties. Adhesion dictates graphene morphology on surrounding materials, which is in turn closely tied to the electronic and mechanical properties of the graphene. However, the adhesive properties of graphene are largely unexplored, partly because the traditional metrologies of adhesion become unsuitable when dealing with samples of extremely small dimensions. This project bypasses previous limitations by extracting adhesive properties directly from the morphology of graphene placed on patterned substrate surfaces and nano-scale scaffolds. A metrology will be developed to measure the adhesion between graphene and a wide-range of materials, particularly using morphological changes on non-flat substrates. The material, morphological, and environmental factors that influence graphene adhesion to surfaces will be determined. Methods will be developed to manipulate the mechanical properties of graphene using surface structures. Results will be achieved through a research framework that integrates experiments (e.g., atomic force microscopy, electronic transport, Raman spectroscopy) and theory (e.g., multi-scale theoretical and numerical modeling).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;There is currently great interest in exploring applications for graphene in next-generation electronics and advanced composite materials. Adhesion plays a pivotal role in the interplay between graphene and other materials, so is a key to the success of future graphene devices and applications. If successful, this project will contribute to an understanding of the interplay between graphene adhesion and morphology which could also have implications for other graphene properties. The energetic framework and experimental protocols developed in this project can be readily adapted to other ultrathin films, and thus have the potential to impact metrology techniques for a wide range of other functional materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project advanced the fundamental understanding of grapheneÆs mechanical properties. Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) material with outstanding chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties, which has led to intense interest in potential device applications. This project focused on the effects of strain and adhesion on graphene, topics integral to the use of graphene in nanoscale devices. The goal of characterizing and manipulating strain and adhesion in graphene was accomplished on several fronts, as described here:  Intellectual merit:  (i) We developed an analytic model to quantitatively determine the graphene adhesion property through its morphology regulated by the strong interaction with the patterned surface of a compliant substrate.  (ii) We demonstrated a feasible approach to engineering strain in graphene by transferring it onto the surface of a micropattern of pyramids on surfaces;  (iii) We developed a coarse-grained modeling scheme to enable the simulation of graphene in a size comparable to that in real samples (e.g., micrometers). We then use this modeling scheme to study the effects of surface compliance and relaxation on the frictional properties of graphene;  (iv) We revealed two types of unconventional applications of strain engineering of graphene:  first, we showed that a highly localized strain field in graphene can generate strong pseudomagnetic fields in graphene that is not possible in lab magnet; second, we demonstrated a facile and effective approach to achieving molecular mass transport on graphene by straining.  Broader Impact:  By offering insights and possible solutions to determine graphene adhesion properties via its morphologic interaction with patterned substrate surfaces, this project addresses a crucial but challenging issue in graphene research. The importance of understanding and controlling graphene adhesion with other materials cannot be overstated in graphene-based device applications. The method of placing patterned graphene onto rigid or flexible substrate that have been patterned with 3D nanostructures may enable a new generation of flexible devices based on graphene or other very thin materials.
