<AbstractNarration>This award creates unique opportunities to bridge US and European technical and policy communities to foster the development of critically needed next-generation alternative energy technologies. It provides 18 travel grants to US students and postdoctoral researchers, including women and under-represented minorities, to attend the Young Engineers and Scientists Symposium  2011 entitled "Alternative Energy: A Global Perspective", a three-day meeting aimed at bringing together a select group of early-career engineers and scientists from the US, France and the United Kingdom. The symposium will facilitate the establishment of new long-term interactions and research partnerships through an agenda crafted to allow participants to discuss a combination of key technical issues, societal and educational topics, and public policy matters related to regulations and funding in the non-fossil energy sector in the US and Europe. Technical sessions will address the core areas of solar, wind, geothermal, biofuel, and nuclear energy with consideration of energy storage and smart energy grids.  Other sessions will focus on the following policy issues: international relations in the field of fossil-free energy; economic perspectives regarding new energy supplies; regulation of fossil free energy and government incentives; and education and teaching needs to train the workforce for the development of non-fossil energy.  This symposium proposes a schedule of diverse plenary lectures, focused parallel technical sessions, and poster sessions with contributions from industry, academia, and government labs. The workshop is jointly organized by the Texas Engineering Experiment Station at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU), the TAMU European Union Center, the British Consulate and the Office of the Scientific Attaché of the French Consulate in Houston.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Overview Scientists and engineers from the U.S. and France have been building collaborative linkages between young scientists since 2007 through a series of workshops and symposia sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and Technology of the Embassy of France, the CNRS, the ANR, the CEA and the SOLEIL in France. This year the United Kingdom joined the Young Engineers and Scientists Symposium (YESS) program. On January 10-12, 2011, over 150 U.S. and European researchers in energy-related science and engineering fields gathered in College Station, Texas&mdash;home of Texas A&amp;M University&mdash;to learn about global alternative energies perspectives as well as current and cutting-edge research at YESS 2011. Approximately 100 of the attendees were students. The main goal of the symposium was to introduce outstanding young scientists interested in alternative energies to each other and further solidify early-stage collaborations. While many such conferences on issues with a global impact are reserved for researchers at the highest level in their fields, YESS 2011 was designed to establish contacts with the next generation of leaders, while facilitating collaboration in science and engineering, transferring new techniques and approaches across fields, and broadening the international community of young scientists and engineers.   The symposium included plenary, technical, and panel sessions, as well as a poster session. Plenary sessions covered energy sector inter&shy;national cooperation; economic perspectives of fossil-free energy; and regulations and public incentives for fossil-free energy. Techni&shy;cal sessions included discussions on nuclear reactors; new technolo&shy;gies for solar energy and biofuels; nuclear fuel cycle; wind energy; small modular reactors; new technologies for energy storage; and geo&shy;thermal energy. The panel session focused on educating a workforce in alternative and nuclear energy. The technical sessions were organized by topic and were given in parallel, dedicated sessions designed to promote high-level scientific and industrial collaboration between Europe and the U.S. by bringing together researchers and engineers in both the industrial and the academic world. The poster session provided students with the opportunity to highlight their research in fields related to what was presented in the plenary and technical sessions and meet profes-sionals and other students from the array of energy fields represented. The agenda allowed participants time to discuss key issues in their field as well as address general topics related to energies, including technical issues such as the storage of energy or the production of a smart energy grid and societal issues, including the education of a new workforce and the environmental impact of these new energy productions. The public policies, regulations, and funding in the energy sector in the U.S. and in Europe were also discussed.  Outcomes The symposium met and exceeded its stated goals:  &bull; To foster industrial and research collaborations between the United States and Europe in the field of fossil-free energies. "I believe the symposium was an outstanding success as I gained a wide variety of knowledge as well as chances to interact with the many experts in the various fields."  "I received a great deal of information about what researchers and companies are working on currently related to developing energy technologies and gained insight about the structure of the energy industry."  &bull; To connect young researchers (PhD candidates and Post Docs) and engineers from each side of the Atlantic to develop long-term exchanges. "This was one of the most useful conferences IÆve been to, and I hope the contacts IÆve made here are long lasting and benefi&shy;cial to energy research."  "The fact that there were so many diverse experts was great for the experience."  &bull; To gather researchers from different domains (solar,...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
