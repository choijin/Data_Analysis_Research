<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at University of South Florida. Through the Chemistry Summer Enhanced Experience Discovering Science (Chem-SEEDS) program in the Department of Chemistry at the University of South Florida (USF), the participant's experience will be enhanced by a pedagogical approach to facilitating development of scientific skills through mentoring and apprenticeship. Each student will be assigned a faculty advisor and a graduate student mentor and together they will explore a broad spectrum of cutting edge chemistry research projects. In addition to being immersed in lab work, the program will offer seminars and workshops on various topics (ethical issues, instrumentation, socio-scientific issues, career opportunities, etc.), informal research lunch talks, and weekly REU research discussion meetings where participants will rotate and present every other week. This peer-centered, collaborative environment will promote collaborative and reflective discussions. To culminate the ten-week summer program the students will present posters at the USF-organized REU Research Day that currently brings together four NSF-sponsored USF REU sites. Student publications and presentations at national and regional meetings are expected outcomes of this program and will be actively encouraged. Chem-SEEDS will incorporate a sound multi-dimensional and multi-instrument evaluation plan that will generate empirical evidence and knowledge regarding the effectiveness of the enhanced experience and may inform the design of other REU programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the nine undergraduates each summer comes from USF and takes the role of host-participant. Chem-SEEDS recruits two-thirds of its participants from STEM-underrepresented groups and will maintain a balanced female-to-male ratio in each of the three years of the program. Recruitment has a special focus on targeting students who lack access to research opportunities, have not considered pursuing science as a career, and are first-generation college students. Partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), as well as the Florida/Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (FGLSAMP) program and community colleges, will insure the recruitment of underrepresented groups of students.</AbstractNarration>
