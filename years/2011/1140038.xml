<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to provide the critical proof that the control of the strain is the key for order-of-magnitude improvement of the optical and magnetic properties of epitaxially grown gallium nitride layers doped with rare earth ions. Controlling this so far hidden parameter that governs the desired coupling of the rare earths ion to the electronic system of the host can have a transformative impact for the utilization of the material system for light emitting and magnetic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is based on experimental findings which show (1) that rare earth ions can be excited most efficiently when they exhibit a strong coupling to the host and (2) that the magnetic states and the resulting magnetization depend on the direction of the piezoelectric field that is induced by lattice mismatch. The program applies advanced microscopy and spectroscopic tools and exploits existing or intentionally induced strain variations across samples to reliably explore the relation between the strain and the coupling and to determine the optimized strain conditions for both electro-luminescence and room-temperature ferromagnetism, which can then be implemented in future device designs.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include the decisive performance improvements that will enable the material system to become an attractive, energy efficient candidate for applications in solid state lighting and for magnetic devices. The outreach activities target involvement of minority students in the research through Lehigh Physics? summer research program and partnerships with faculty from historically black colleges.</AbstractNarration>
