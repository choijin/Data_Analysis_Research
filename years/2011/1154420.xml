<AbstractNarration>This project supports a 2012 pre-and post-election survey that re-interviews 18,000 citizens nationwide who were originally surveyed during the 2010 election. Ultimately, this will result in one of the largest multi-year election panel surveys ever produced. This panel design provides a way for researchers to better understand how public opinion, political attitudes, and electoral behavior change from one election to the next. The large panel provides sufficient statistical power to measure the dynamics of opinion change within groups, such as ethnic, economic, or partisan groups or within particular areas of the country.  As a result, the power of this panel provides new insights on a wide range of research questions.  For example, how does the composition of the electorate change from midterm elections to presidential elections?  What is the impact of redistricting on voter engagement? How does the electorate hold the government accountable for the economy? And what role do deployments or casualties play in affecting support for U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts? The answers to these questions will contribute to our understanding of how to sustain an informed and engaged citizenry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The panel dataset produced by this project will be made available to the scholarly community and will be an important resource for scholars interested in a wide variety of questions ranging including how attitudes change over time, the impact of redistricting, and the administration of elections, and will additionally contribute to the advancement of survey research methods. We anticipate that the results here will be highly useful in assessing the effects of shifts in district and precincts on election administration.  The PIs will communicate these results to administrators, especially through the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project and associated activities. Finally, this project fosters education. This grant supports the production of educational materials related to the survey, so that faculty can readily integrate this and other panel studies into their courses and students can use this survey for thesis and other research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) 2010-2012 Panel Survey  interviewed 18,000 US adults in 2010 and again in 2012.  It is the largest such panel study (in which the same people are interviewed in both years) ever conducted in U. S. elections.  The sample size is ten times larger than any other panel conducted during U. S. elections.   It is also the first panel survey to span redistricting years.   The large sample size of the 2010-2012 CCES Panel Survey allows researchers to study the methodology of panel surveys, especially on-line surveys.  The large number of people interviewed make it possible to study how specific groups respond to panel studies, and whether some sorts of people are significantly more likely to drop out of panel surveys.  This information will aid the planning of future panel surveys in a wide range of fields.  The 2010-2012 Panel Survey reveals how individualsÆ opinions and voting behaviors changed from the 2010 midterm election to the 2012 presidential election.   Midterm elections have long been known to have lower turnout and return very different election results from presidential elections.   This survey allows researchers to see who votes in presidential elections but not midterm elections, how much peopleÆs attitudes toward parties and candidates change from the midterms to the presidential elections, and how the voting behavior of individuals changes with the different electoral contexts.     The core of the American electorate is defined as those people who vote in both midterm and presidential elections.   The study finds that the core of the U.S. electorate today leans toward the Republican party, is more conservative than the average voter, has attained a higher level of education, and has higher average income.  This finding helps us understand the pattern of electoral swings that have been observed in the U.S. since the 1990s.   The design of the study also allows researchers to examine the effects of redistricting on the American electorate.   The panel survey has a very large sample and spans the redistricting process, with the 2010 election conducted under district lines drawn in 2001 and the 2012 election conducted under district lines drawn in 2011.  The survey reveals that changes in district boundaries have very large effects on votersÆ knowledge about the elections, including the party, race, gender, and ideological orientation of the candidates running for office.   The large sample design allows researchers to study how changes in peoplesÆ lives, from the weather to marital status to election laws, affect changes in their understanding of politics, their opinions about public policies, and the voting behavior.
