<AbstractNarration>Flavonoids are a major group of compounds that are produced by plants. In addition to their significant roles in the plant life cycle, flavonoids have important food properties, including contributions to flavor and anti-oxidant activity. The focus of this research is to advance our understanding of the manner in which specific flavonoids are produced in the grapefruit. Specifically, the structure and function of the enzymes (the glucosyltransferases) that add sugar groups to the flavonoids  will be studied, and the roles that these enzymes play in the production of different classes of flavonoid will be defined.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project will provide training and educational opportunities at a predominantly undergraduate institution located in an economically disadvantaged region within Southern Appalachia.  The modular nature of this research is well suited to the engagement of undergraduate and M.S. students in comprehensive research experiences that include designing and executing experiments, analyzing results, making presentations at scientific meetings, and preparing articles for publication.  The PI will mentor undergraduate students about career opportunities, and will engage in outreach to middle school, high school and elementary school students and teachers through a variety of activities that include workshops, mentoring classes and individual student research activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Flavonids are a major group of compounds that are produced by plants. In addition to their significant roles in the plant life cycle, flavonoids have important food properties, including contributions to flavor and anti-oxidant activity.  Most of these compounds that are present in plants have sugars attached which helps with solubility and transport. The focus of this research was to advance our understanding of the group of enzymes responsible for adding the sugar to the flavonoid compounds; these enzymes are called GTs.  We isolated several genes for prospective GTs from grapefruit and screened the enzymes to learn which reactions they carry out.  One of these enzymes was highly specific for one subgroup of flavonoids and much of our work focused on testing which particular regions of the enzyme were responsible for its specific activity.  The long term view is that if we can understand which areas of the enzyme are important for function and where changes in structure can result in altered function, we may be able to custom design enzymes to make desired compounds.  We found several amino acids that are critical for function of this enzyme.  We found other areas of amino acids that were more flexible and/or altered the enzymeÆs ability to add sugar to another subgroup of flavonoids.  These results make a significant contribution to the overall knowledge about the function of this large group of enzymes, the plant secondary product GTs.  This research was conducted at a predominantly undergraduate university located in an economically disadvantaged region within Southern Appalachia.  It provided direct training, education, and comprehensive research opportunities for 8 undergraduate students, 6 masterÆs degree students, and one post-doctoral researcher. Each student had her or his own specific research project and gained experience in designing and executing experiments, analyzing results, making formal presentations at professional meetings, and preparing articles for publication. The graduate students and the postdoctoral researcher also gained significant, mentored teaching experiences. This grant support also provided the opportunity for outreach and service to k-12 students in the region through our participation in local and regional science fairs and in "STEM Day" activities in local schools.
