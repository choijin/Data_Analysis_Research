<AbstractNarration>This US-French collaboration seeks to further our understanding  of the photochemical processes taking place in snow and firn, and the influences they may have on surface exchange between snowpack and the polar atmosphere. Such processes potentially impact the atmospheric composition of trace gases over the Antarctic continent.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vertically and temporally resolved records of ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), CO  as well as selected hydrocarbons  in the lower 10m of the atmosphere at Dome C will be sought over the course of this ~1+ season. Shading perturbation  experiments will also be undertaken to investigate photochemical transformations of photochemical oxidants in interstitial snowpack air.  Similar measurements that have been made at Summit (Greenland) will provide a basis for comparison, and a further refinement of a physical and chemical snowpack model depicting our understanding of snowpack-atmosphere chemical cycling in polar ice sheets.  By providing the core of a CU graduate student research project, this effort fosters  international research connections.</AbstractNarration>

In November 2012, an underground laborotory, a meteorological tower, and below surface snow air inlets connected to a sampling system was installed for continuous measurements of reactive gases in the snowpack and in air above the snowpack surface.  Measured species included ozone, nitrogen oxides, gaseous elemental mercury, and formaldehyde.  These gases are formed by photochemical processes triggered by sun light, so they show very strong seasonal cycles due to the stark 24-hour sunlight to 24-hour darkness annual cycle at this 75 degree south, 3233 meters above sea level Antarctic research site. The experiment yielded &gt;97% data coverage representing the first full seasonal cycle of these gases in the interior of Antarctica.  All gases show seasonal concentration changes and very dynamic snow-atmosphere exchanges.  Concentration differences between the snowpack air and ambient air above the surface were applied to infer the fluxes of gases (always from higher to lower concentration gradients).  Determination of these gas exchanges is of importance for deciphering the role of snowpack chemistry on the chemical composition of the atmosphere and the atmospheric reactive gas chemistry.  Occasional events of local exhaust transport from the station power generating plant that uses liquid hydrocarbon fuel exerted a major influence on trace gas levels and chemistry in the snowpack, lasting from a few days to 1-2 weeks.
