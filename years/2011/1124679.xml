<AbstractNarration>DeVincent Wolf&lt;br/&gt;1124679&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for the partial support of a symposium titled "Synthesis and Processing of Organic and Polymeric Materials for Semiconductor Applications", to be held at the 2011 Materials Research Society (MRS) Spring Meeting, Apr. 25-29, 2011, in San Francisco, California.   The synthesis and processing of organic materials for photovoltaics and solid-state lighting constitutes a multidisciplinary research area which converges at the interface of synthetic organic chemistry, materials science and engineering, semiconductor physics, and device engineering.  This symposium provides an ideal opportunity for scientists and engineers from different disciplines to share their results and insights in the field of organic semiconductors, with a highlight on novel synthesis and processing methods to fabricate organic and functional polymeric materials which applications to photovoltaics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will provide travel support for oral and poster presenters, who consist mainly of new and emerging workers in the field.   In particular, this support will provide an opportunity for student attendees to become familiar with state-of-the-art organic semiconductor technologies.   Undergraduate participation in the poster sessions will be encouraged as a means of exposing students to a high level of research at an early stage in their careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Photovoltaics and solid state lighting are examples of technologies that are envisaged in a new sustainable energy economy, since these technologies would enable us to use a renewable energy source and to use energy sources we already have more efficiently.  A key impediment to realizing this vision is the cost and sustainability of these materials and technologies.  However, organic and functional polymeric materials may offer an economic alternative to inorganic materials.  This symposium will be the venue for papers discussing novel synthesis and processing methods to fabricate organic and functional polymeric materials.  The main theme of this symposium is related with organic-based photovoltaics and solid state lighting.  The worldÆs leading researchers will be invited to talk their latest results. This is not only a good opportunity to boost the progress of sustainability related scientific research, but also a great educational opportunity to participated students, i.e. our future generation of working force.  Symposium OO was a very successful and significant event for the international materials research community.  It generated worldwide interest and attracted over 300 attendees in this symposium.  There were a number of scientific highlights remarkable for their fundamental depth and state-of-the-art technology.  Yang Yang (Univ. of California, Los Angeles) discussed their recent progress of polymer bulk hetereojunction organic solar cells, which leads to a single organic solar cell with a power efficiency close to 8-9%; Marc Baldo (MIT) described the use of singlet fission materials for enhanced photon harvesting in the device settings; Steve Forrest (Univ. of Michigan) explored several processing methods to control the morphology of donor-acceptor mixed layers inside of organic solar cells; Seva Rostovtsev (DuPont) and Joseph Shiang (GE) both discussed their teamÆs efforts on the development of materials for organic-based displays and solid state lighting.  The synthesis and processing of organic materials for photovoltaics and solid state lighting constitutes a truly multidisciplinary research area which converges at the interface of synthetic organic chemistry, materials science and engineering, semiconductor physics, and device engineering.  This symposium has provided an ideal opportunity for scientists and engineers from different disciplines to share their results and insights in the field of organic semiconductors, with a high-light on novel synthesis and processing methods to fabricate organic and functional polymeric materials.   A large number of student speakers and poster presenters (including undergraduates) contributed to a very vibrant and interactive atmosphere of the Symposium, which allowed them to enhance their professional and communicating skills.  NSF funds have provided the financial assistance to 10 talented young researchers, including 1 assistant professor, 1 postdoc and 9 graduate students.
