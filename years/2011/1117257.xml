<AbstractNarration>This project investigates computational techniques for modeling dissipative physical systems experiencing contact, impact, friction and plasticity. The attendant optimization problems are strongly nonlinear, nonsmooth, and nonconvex in nature, necessitating the development of novel numerical methods. The research grounds the development of these methods by building on discrete geometric mechanics and variational integrators, which restate the fundamental principles of physics in a discrete, hence immediately computable form. The research examines five core behaviors arising from the Principle (momentum/energy/symmetry preservation, breaking contact, and non-interpenetration) and thereby derives computer algorithms whose outputs capture these physical behaviors. The project success is measured by (a) the production of novel computer algorithms that are able to simulate dissipative physical phenomena more accurately and efficiently than ever before, (b) new theoretical results on what can be expected of computer algorithms that simulate these phenomena, and (c) the successful adoption of the novel techniques by industry partners. The project results are publicly disseminated via articles in journals, release of source code on the world wide web, and transfer of technological expertise and data to industrial partners. &lt;br/&gt;Improving computational techniques for the simulation of contact, impact, and dissipative phenomena helps make engineering safety analyses, biomechanical models, computer visualizations, surgical training tools, and industrial manufacturing simulations that better predict reality. Algorithms that accurately capture the physics help to gain important new insights into many open questions that influence our understanding of large-scale geophysics of earthquakes and calving of icebergs, small-scale dissipation in high-frequency micro- and nano-electronic mechanical devices, prosaic domestic phenomena such as the chattering of chalk on a board and even the excitation of violin strings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Computer simulation has become widely accepted as an integral part of the scientific method, augmenting the traditional dyad of theory and experiment. Scientists and engineers are increasingly interested in conducting computational simulations in domains ranging from automotive design-space exploration to biomedical device optimization and customization.      Predicting the behavior of contact, impact, and dissipative phenomena is a necessary component of such computer simulations, especially in contexts such as engineering safety analyses, biomechanical modeling, real-time video games, surgical training tools, cinematic special effects, industrial manufacturing and virtual and augmented reality.  This project developed fundamental computer algorithms to more accurately capture the physics of sustained contact, sudden impact, and dissipation via friction, plasticity, and viscosity.  The project research activities involved (1) development of theoretical foundations for the discrete variational treatment of contact, impact, and dissipation in physical simulation, (2) design and implementation of physical simulation software, (3) evaluation and validation of software in collaboration with collaborating academics and industrial partners, and (4) development of educational curriculum related to computer simulation of dissipative mechanical systems.  For example of one such activity, the project involved the study of simultaneous impacts, an open and significant problem in collision response modeling.
