<AbstractNarration>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) publishes periodical reports (assessments) informing policymakers and the public on issues related to global climate change. The IPCC uses verbal descriptions of uncertainty (such as unlikely) to convey the underlying imprecision of its forecasts and conclusions. Previous studies showed that the public interprets these probabilistic statements as less extreme than intended by the authors, and that there are large individual differences in the interpretation of these statements. These studies suggest that supplementing the probability words with numerical ranges would increase differentiation between terms and consistency of interpretation.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climate change is a global issue and the IPCC is a global body whose reports and conclusions are translated to many languages and have international impact. This project is a collaborative multi-national study of the of IPCC communication of uncertainty. We plan to administer translated questionnaires in many countries, to investigate cross-national differences in interpretation of probabilistic pronouncements, relate those to attitudes towards global climate change, and outline methods to improve the effectiveness of communication. Our results and recommendations should help improve the way the IPCC communicate uncertainty in its future reports.</AbstractNarration>

As predicted, the IPCC are interpreted by the public as indicating probabilities much closer to 50% than the authors of the IPCC report intended. The Dual (Verbal - Numerical) format was found to be highly beneficial: (a) the level of correspondence between the publicÆs interpretation of the terms and the IPCC guidelines increased significantly; (b) the terms were better differentiated by the readers; and (c) the range of values associate with the various terms was reduced.

This change would improve the effectiveness of the communication by appealing to readers who prefer different communication modes and have various levels of numeracy, would facilitate communication across cultural and linguistic bounds and would allow the IPCC more flexibility.
