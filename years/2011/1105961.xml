<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Muon spin relaxation (MuSR) measurements provide unique information on the ordered volume fraction, moment size, slow spin fluctuations, and critical behavior for studies of magnetic ordering, and allow reliable determination of the superfluid density in type-II superconductors. The present project aims to study exotic spin and charge correlations in novel superconducting and magnetic systems by extensive MuSR measurements at TRIUMF (Canada) and PSI (Switzerland).  The present research covers: (1) quantum critical behaviors and Skyrmion spin correlations in weak itinerant ferro/helical magnets MnSi and FeGe, (2) novel ferromagnetic system Li(Zn,Mn)As generated by doping charge (with excess Li) and spin (with Mn) into the I-II-V semiconductor LiZnAs, and (3) various FeAs, CuO and heavy fermion superconductors, with a special focus on strange/unexplained behaviors in the overdoped regions.  Success of the present project will advance understanding of very strong and unconventional spin-charge couplings found in many of these systems, and possibly contribute to development of new superconducting and spin-tronics systems and devices. The MuSR measurements will be performed in extensive international collaborations, providing opportunities for development of graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral students and researchers in a unique multi-national environment and facilities. Outreach plans include development of on-line lecture courses, and involvement of high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Over the last 30 years, solid state physics has developed with discoveries of many novel and unconventional materials and phenomena.  They include high-Tc CuO superconductors, doped ferromagnetic semiconductors, and systems existing in the boundary of magnetically ordered and disordered (or suprconducting) states.  The key element of these systems is strong interaction between spins (origin of magnetism) and charges (required for metallic, semiconducting, or superconducting behaviors).  Another notable development of modern solid state physics is the use of large accelerator facilities which produce high-intensity beams of X-rays, neutrons and muons. The present project will use positive muons obtained at dedicated high-intensity accelerator facilities in Canada (TRIUMF) and Switzerland (PSI) to elucidate detailed relationship between magnetic (spin) and conductive (charge) phenomena. Rsearch advances may contribute to development of novel materials for superconducting and / or spin-sensitive electronics (spintronics) devices. The muon measurements will be performed in international collaboration including gropus from the US, Canada, Japan, China, Brazil, UK and Switzerland, which will help development of students and researchers in a unique multi-national environment. Educational/outreach activities include the development of on-line lecture courses for solid state physics, associated with text books and lab courses. In cooperation with TRIUMF's outreach activities, the project supports involvements of high school students and physics teachers in forefront experimental research using very large accelerator facilities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Muon Spin Relaxation (MuSR) is a modern experimental method for studying magnetism and superconductivity of solids by using muon beam obtained from high intensity accelerator facilities.  In the present project, the PI performed MuSR measurements at TRIUMF (Vancouver, Canada) and PSI (Villigen, Switzerland) to elucidate (a) novel superconductors and related magnetic systems, (b) novel metallic weakly-magnetic systems adjacent to paramagnetic phase, (c) diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS), (d) spin systems with frustrated magnetic interactions, and (e) typical non-superconducting Mott insulator systems.    Intellectural Merit:  In (a), magnetically ordered phase was discovered in (Sr,Ca)2(Ru,Ti)O4 in a wide range of Sr-rich region near the superconducting phase of Sr2RuO4 [Nature Physics], and charge density wave order was discovered in BaTi2(As,Sb)2O near the superconducting state [Nature Communications].  In addition, utilizing a unique detection ability of MuSR, the size of the magnetic moment in static ordering and the volume fraction of the ordered region have been separately determined in antiferromagnetic "parent" compounds of the "122", "112" and "111" families of Fe-based superconductors.  In (b), the present project has revealed first-order behavior in quantum evolution towards paramagnetic phases from antiferromagnetic TiAu [Nature Commun.] and ferromagnetic (Sc,Lu)3In [Phys. Rev. X], and elucidated dynamic and static behaviors of the vortex-like Skyrmion spin order in MnSi.   In (c), the PI and his Chinese materials collaborators discovered and characterized novel DMS systems [2 Nature Communications] which have crystal structures identical or similar to those of FeAs superconductors. These new DMS systems have already achieved highest ferromagnetic transition temperature of 230 K, and exhibited availability in bulk crystal form, which is a great advantage over previously known DMS system (Ga,Mn)As available only in thin films.  In (d), the PI corrected erroneous report on magnetic monopole motion in a Spin ice compound Dy2Ti2O7 [Phys. Rev. Lett.].  In (e), in evolution from Mott insulator to paramagnetic metal in quantum tuning via applied or chemical pressure, the PI demonstrated a volume-wise disappearance of magnetic order, with a discontinuous change of the ordered moment size, in typical Mott insulator systems V2O3 and RENiO3, associated with phase separation [Nature Communications].  In quantum evolution from magnetically ordered to superconducting or paramagnetic phases at low temperatures, achieved by chemical substitutions or applications of pressure, the MuSR results on (Sr,Ca)2(Ru,Ti)O4, parent compounds of FeAs superconductors, TiAu, Sc3In, MnSi, V2O3 and (Rare-Earth)NiO3 all exhibit first-order behavior often associated with phase separation between regions with magnetically ordered and disordered volumes.  This is a very important new finding, which suggests possible generic involvements of first order transition in quantum magnetic phase transitions.  Broader impact and  human resource development:   The present project supported stipend of Columbia graduate student Lian Liu for most of the period after he joined the PI?s research group.  Liu performed collaborative studies in most of the above mentioned subjects, and finished PhD in February of 2016 based on the MuSR results in MnSi.  The present project has provided partial support for operation and travel costs for MuSR experiments at TRIUMF and PSI, to which many graduate students participated.  They include Lian Liu, Carlos Arguello, Ben Frandsen, Sky Cheung (Columbia),  Eteri Svanidze (Rice), Zheng Deng, Kan Zhao, Bijuan Chen, Shengli Guo (IOP Beijing), Hakuto Suzuki (Tokyo U), Cui Ding (Zhejiang U), and Shan Jiang (UCLA), whose PhD projects have strong scientific connection with the present project.   The MuSR beamtime at TRIUMF and PSI also involved following graduate students in unique international collaboration:  Adam Aczel, Travis Williams, Tim Munsie, Alannah Hallas, Murray Wilson, Yipeng Cai, Telesa Medina, Robert D?Ortenzio (McMaster), Julian Munevar (CBPF-Rio), Scott Car, David Tam  (Rice), Taito Murakami, Yasumasa Nozaki (Kyoto U), Shyoya Sakamoto, and Goro Shibata (Tokyo U).  Combining supports from the present grant and NSF-PIRE grant, the PI Uemura initiated a live/simulcast/video lecture course entitled "Frontiers of Condensed Matter Physics" (FCMP) at Columbia in 2011 for entry-level and senior graduate students. Each FCMP lecturer, chosen among leading CMP physicists, delivers one or two 75 minute talks on his/her own research subjects with special care given for pedagogical, intuitive and historical presentation, so that an entry-level student has several clear take-home messages from the lecture. More than 140 FCMP lectures have been recorded in high-quality videos, and made available for lecture courses and seminars in the US, Japan and China.

This activity was also associated with annual workshops and/or student tours, at Tokyo U and Kyoto U (2013), Beijing IOP (2014), and TRIUMF (2015), which were attended by more than 200 graduate students.
