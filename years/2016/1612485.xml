<AbstractNarration>The connections between technology applications of all sorts and human users that are ubiquitous in informal learning and assume a great deal about how the technology is used and how learning takes place.  Much of the research in this area has been focused on game design and interaction.  This project will examine this interaction involving the use of gestures that represent how individuals work with systems and large data sets that represent complex systems like the oceans, to understand how basic elements of a project with a 3-D type of design might enhance the user experience and increase the utility and learning that takes place by understanding the cognitive elements of these game like interactions in specific STEM related settings like museums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory pathways project will investigate the use of interactive, gesture-enabled, multi-touch spheres for teaching about ocean systems in science centers and museums. The gesture-enabled aspect of the project will improve on interactive table-top installations which can frustrate users who use unexpected gestures and receive no response leading to brief interaction and abandonment without significant interaction or learning. The project will investigate ways in which unsupported gestures would still produce a system response which would encourage the user to remain at the installation and continue to investigate.  The effect of multiple gestures will be supported by using natural mappings between gestures and interactions with the on-sphere data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates theories of embodied cognition that support the notion that by engaging with global-scale datasets on a spherical display more effectively models the earth in a non-distorted manner and therefore will be more natural and allow users to develop a more accurate conceptual model of how data relates to itself and the globe. In this way, the project shares some aspects of understanding about learning through game play. The sphere will not be a fully developed game but will share characteristics of game play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Touch Interaction for Data Engagement with Science on Spheres (TIDESS) program focused on designing new experiences for learners to engage with Earth science data visualizations on a touch-interactive spherical globe display in informal learning settings such as science centers and museums. Our research used frequent design iterations in a design-based research methodology that included cycles of both lab-based research and <em>in situ </em>museum research.</p> <p>In year one, we conducted an exploratory study with a prototype running on a flatscreen tabletop in a lab setting with 11 family groups (at least one adult and at least one child age 8-13 per group). Our design helped groups to learn about science content shown in the visualizations and also to use science practices such as asking questions and refining each other?s ideas. We also found evidence of groups using language that suggested they might be employing <em>embodied cognition </em>as they worked with our visualizations. Embodied cognition theory suggests humans use their bodies and the surrounding environment as tools to help when thinking and learning, rather than solely using their brain. Using the language evidence we found, we also examined the touchscreen gestures people used to interact with the visualizations to help us understand how they could be using their bodies when working with data visualizations. We acquired the sphere display as well and began adapting our tabletop version of the data visualization prototype to the new technology. Our partners, the sphere developers, adapted their software by adding new interactive functionality based on our research with the tabletop as part of the process of creating our prototype experience for the sphere.</p> <p>In year 2, we conducted two studies to advance our understanding of how children and adults learn with spherical displays. Our first was a combination of focus groups on ocean content and a design probe with the spherical display. The focus groups revealed that both adults and children want to learn about sea creatures and physical phenomena like rip tides. Both groups wanted to learn about human impact on the ocean as well as impacts humans may feel from the ocean, especially as it changes over time. This finding suggests that lifelong learners have a concern for information about human activities that both harm and help conserve the ocean and its inhabitants. From the design probes, we learned that multiple children will interact with the sphere simultaneously, while adults seem to prefer to let one person take charge and guide the experience. Children also often wanted to use all five fingers to contact the sphere, which new exhibit designs for spherical displays ultimately must accommodate. This led to our second study, elicitation of touchscreen gestures that people would want to use on the sphere to make certain things happen in the data visualization. We found that, unlike with flatscreen displays, all users were more likely to use multiple fingers or whole hand gestures. Our sphere developer partners continued to implement new software features based on our research, as we iteratively revised the design of our prototype experience for the sphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In Year 3, we deployed our resulting prototype experience for the sphere as a standalone, unfacilitated data visualization exhibit at the Florida Museum of Natural History for a week. We videotaped users interacting with the sphere, and data analysis continues beyond the scope of the funded project. Our preliminary analysis suggests people tend to engage with the data visualizations for both open-ended and directed investigation, supported by explicit <em>scaffolds </em>presented in our prototype design. This deployment in a public space with a representative audience of museum-goers was part of our broader impacts of the grant, in addition to the involvement of our research participants in participatory co-design activities conducted in public areas such as our county libraries over the life of the project. We also produced a video on the project for NSF?s STEM for All Video Showcase in 2019, available here: <a href="https://stemforall2019.videohall.com/presentations/1499">https://stemforall2019.videohall.com/presentations/1499</a>.</p> <p>Finally, we involved a diverse set of undergraduate (11 total, including 6 REU students) and graduate research assistants (4 total) and a postdoctoral associate on the project, from both computer science and education research.
