<AbstractNarration>This award is to support a US-led international forum for the exchange of ideas, modeling skill and knowledge on the Arctic Ocean. The goal is to improve our understanding of oceanic and sea-ice processes and mechanisms driving Arctic Ocean changes. Although its future focus will depend to a large degree on the decisions of the participants as their research develops, there are three broad areas of interest now identified: the development and analysis of modeling and observing at high and very high spatial and temporal resolution, identification of uncertainties and errors in models, and recommendations for improvements of existing models. A coordinated international community approach to the investigation of Arctic Ocean variability is the best way to assess uncertainty in results and conclusions made by different modelers, scientific groups, or institutions. Moreover, it ensures leveraging of research talent and expenditures in other parts of the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project that will have broader impacts will be is a synthesis that integrates observational and modeling efforts toward the overall goal of developing advanced Arctic models able to accurately simulate the past, describe the present, and predict future Arctic conditions. One of the largest broader impacts of the activity is educational, because the forum specifically targets the development of young scientists participating in the project, provides guidelines for critical analysis of the existing models, and fruitful improvements and developments of the Arctic models by a new generation of Arctic modelers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this award is to employ high and very high resolution models and observations to investigate the role of sub-grid processes in regional ocean and sea ice models of the Arctic seas. The project will be focused on targeting important scientific problems and enhancing collaboration and coordination among arctic marine modelers, theoreticians, and observationalists. This work will be managed in teleconferences, virtual workshops, newsletters, and annual meetings with one-day schools for young and developing arctic researchers. The project will support synthesis across the suite of Arctic models and observations by: (i) Conducting coordinated research on modeling with resolutions resolving small scale processes (for example, resolving eddies and internal waves); (ii) Holding scientific meetings and schools for new investigators including virtual teleconferences; (iii) Creating teams of modelers, theoreticians, and observationalists to work on topical issues of Arctic sea ice and oceanic dynamics and thermodynamics; (iv) Conducting collaboration with other similar projects focused on other aspects of arctic/global climate (atmospheric, terrestrial, cryospheric); (v) Disseminating findings to broader communities; and (vi) Training a new generation of ocean and sea-ice observationalists and modelers. The most significant contributions are likely to be results of internationally coordinated development and analysis of modeling and observing at high and very high resolution; identification of uncertainties and errors and causes of these errors and model discrepancies, and recommendations for improvements of existing regional coupled ice-ocean models and Global Climate Models, by implementing new physics for Arctic processes.</AbstractNarration>

In 2016-2020, more than 300 (including more than 40 students and postdocs) FAMOS-2 collaborators published 65 papers in peer reviewed journals, organized three annual meetings and participated in a set of specifically designed experiments (e.g. has supported synthesis across the suite of Arctic models and observations; see project website for details).   One of the foci of the FAMOS-2 project was improving Arctic regional ice&#8208;ocean models and understanding of physical processes regulating variability of Arctic environmental conditions based on synthesis of observations and model results.
