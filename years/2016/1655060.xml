<AbstractNarration>General Audience Summary     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is a doctoral dissertation improvement grant. It supports a project investigating the work experience of Uber drivers and the legal disputes about them and their work. The investigators conducted an extensive ethnographic field study of Uber drivers this year in Boston, and they discovered that Uber's algorithms yield great power over how workers work largely, by revealing certain pieces of information but concealing others. In the project supported by this grant, the investigators will extend their sampling method, interview protocol, and analytic coding to Copenhagen, Denmark, for comparative purposes. They aim to understand Uber's emergent "digital working class" in another political economy (a social democracy), with different norms concerning urban transportation (a strong cultural preference for bicycling), and under a different legal system and legal consciousness. The research will generate insights for academic and policy audiences interested in regulating this workforce and its activity. The results will be reported in several articles written for both specialist and non-specialist audiences, and contribute to a doctoral dissertation to be later published as a book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will work towards bridging a gap in understanding about new kinds of work that are emerging consequent to technology by comparing qualitative data about the experience of Uber workers in two national contexts, the US (Boston) and Denmark (Copenhagen). They plan to acquire and analyze ethnographic data alongside historical and contemporary legal disputes about labor in general and ride-for-hire in particular. As sociologists and STS scholars, the investigators are interested in the relationship between individuals and organizations, including regulatory ones, in the information economy. While ensuing legal case have focused on questions such as whether to classify "on-demand" workers as employees or contractors and whether the service provided is safe, the investigators will focus on underlying debates having to do with class and power, equity and fairness, and design and use in the emergence of new technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project undertook to resarch the work experiences of Uber drivers, and legal disputes regarding their activity, in Copenhagen, Denmark, and to compare these results to the outcomes of an earlier study carried out in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  The project yielded two primary findings of interest.   First, Copenhagen drivers exhibited a set of mindsets and practices associated with the concept of "regulatory breach," developed through the earlier Boston study. Regulatory breach is the process by which a firm uses software to coordinate drivers to deliver a service, while evading&mdash;wittingly or unwittingly&mdash;the legal regulations that govern the activity they are doing. Because of the comparatively rapid, "paperless" nature of enrolling in the Uber workforce (via downloading software and assenting to its "user agreement") drivers are typically initially unaware of specific legal requirements pertaining to their work. As large numbers of drivers sign up to work via Uber?s software, they overwhelm the comparatively small enforcement staff of the regulatory system (e.g., the hackney divisions of police departments), executing what we refer to as a "breach" of that system. We refer both to a violation of law, and also to the idea of exceeding a limit: opening up a space within the regulatory system for new practices to be carried out, via what has in other contexts been called "disruptive innovation" (where new market entrants disrupt established players in an industry).  We observed during the period of study that it was common for Uber drivers in Copenhagen to request that riders occupy the front seat, in order to make it appear that the rider was an acquaintance of the driver, and not a hired fare. Correlated to this, drivers frequently kept their smartphone devices below the windshield level to make it difficult for people outside to see the Uber app displayed. Some drivers made explicit appeals to riders to carry out a performance if the driver was stopped by police, asking riders to assert to police that the ride was a carpool or that the rider was friends with the driver, and not seeking for-hire transportation.  What this shows is that when a new source of on-demand income becomes available with low barriers to entry, such as via software downloaded to a pocket computer (the "smartphone"), income-seekers will participate in a market for exchange (in this instance, of car-and-driver services) irrespective of local differences in law, if they feel they can breach the regulatory system undetected. Regulatory processes are a barrier to entry for the casual, part-time laborer who composes the greatest portion of Uber?s workforce: the person who wants to work on-demand, for periods of time of their choosing, and who does not want to undergo occupational transformation into a taxi or livery driver&mdash;the kind of transformation that regulation effectuates through registration, testing, and/or licensing.
