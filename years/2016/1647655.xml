<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide the first technical advancement in the specialty metals industry (manufacturers of titanium and nickel) in more than 4 decades. Specialty metals are ubiquitous in our lives, with applications from aircraft parts to medical implants, yet the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process, the work horse for this industry, has remained relatively unchanged since its development in the 1940?s. By coupling the ability to measure the location of electric arcs used for melting these high value alloys in the VAR, with the ability to steer the arcs, substantial electrical savings can be achieved, decreasing costs to the consumer and increasing reliability of the final products. For example, it is well known that the lack of understanding of the dynamics of the process leads to an estimated 8% yield loss, costing the US industry $1.024B per year in lost revenue through yield loss and electrical inefficiency, contributing to the high price of these products. This project proposes to decrease this loss by 50% by developing an applied feedback control technology capable of optimizing the energy distribution within these systems, providing better quality metals at a cheaper production price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to prove that real-time control can improve plasma-based industrial processing systems. The innovation uses externally applied magnetic fields to manipulate arc position modes during melting operations. By coupling arc position sensing, which measures magnetic field vectors exterior to the process to determine arc positions interior to it, with active manipulation of externally derived fields, arcs can be precisely controlled. Relying upon years of development and validation of arc position sensing, coupled with Finite Element Analysis simulations and experimental validation, this technology will become the first active control of arc melting systems. The significant realization is that spatial and temporal control of the diffuse current paths can be controlled precisely if the validated measurement system of current location is coupled with external field generators. This effort will focus on the application to VAR furnaces but may have significant application to other processes with diffuse current pathways such as Joule heated systems, fuel cells, additive manufacturing or industrial microwave processing. The expected impact of arc control during melting is a reduction in manufacturing defects, an enablement of the production of ingots with increasing diameter, a reduction in energy required in alloy production, and improved safety of operations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This Phase I National Science Foundation SBIR award provides proof of concept for the Vacuum Arc Control methodology based upon the patented Arc Position Sensing (APS) Technology and Ampere Scientific&rsquo;s <em>VARmetric</em><sup>TM</sup> measurement system. Vacuum Arc Remelting (VAR) furnaces are the workhorse for the manufacture of high value metals and alloys (Ni, Ti, Nb, Zr, Hf, etc).&nbsp; Yet, melting in VAR furnaces has remained relatively unchanged since its introduction in the 1940s. It is well known that the behavior of the electric arcs during VAR processing impacts product yield and contributes to ingot defects. Until the introduction of <em>VARmetric</em><sup>TM</sup>, there were no technologies capable of measuring the location of electric arcs during melting and therefore no way to quantify the relationship between arc location and defects such as those that caused the jet engine failure and complete loss of aircraft on American Airlines Flight 383. Operational variations in arc locations not only lead to defect formation, they also lead to yield or productivity losses, estimated at more than $1.024B per year in lost revenue in the U. S. alone.&nbsp; This NSF SBIR provides proof of concept for coupling arc position sensing through <em>VARmetric</em><sup>TM</sup> with applied magnetic fields to control arc locations, and thus provide a means of avoiding operational conditions leading to defects.&nbsp; Additionally, the energy transfer to the melt pool can be optimized, increasing electrical efficiency, while the integrated Vacuum Arc Control (VAC) system will provide the advanced process control necessary to advance the state of the industry.</p> <p>For this NSF SBIR, Ampere Scientific successfully developed a laboratory arc furnace for validating the VAC control. This arc furnace integrated our patented Arc Position Sensing technology with an independent optical monitoring system of the arcs.&nbsp; Figure 2 provides a comparison of the determined arc positions from the two measurement systems, which are in good agreement.</p> <p>We developed a 3-axis Helmholtz coil configuration to generate magnetic forces in any known direction.&nbsp; The 3-axis Helmholtz coils were designed using COMSOL Multi-physics finite element modeling software to inform the coil diameter, spacing and number of windings to produce a given magnetic field strength and uniformity. This approach allowed us to specify a design which yielded field strengths approximately equivalent to existing VAR industry applications of axial magnetic fields for stirring. A coil picture is shown in Figure 3, along with validating results to show we can move the arcs with magnetic field application in our laboratory arc furnace.</p> <p>Ultimately, our goal was to provide proof that we could alter the arc distribution in a known way. Previously, we have sometimes observed a &ldquo;ring&rdquo; arc distribution mode with APS &nbsp;during industrial VAR melting. This distribution is the result of the arcs tending to be concentrated closer to the electrode edge than the center, and travelling in a circular pattern.&nbsp; We used this distribution mode as our control target.&nbsp; Figure 4 (t1-t8) shows the results of applying the indicated magnetic field vector (arrow) to control the arc distribution over an approximately 8s period. Figure 4 demonstrates the rotation of the arc centroid around the electrode surface as intended .&nbsp; The overall distribution of the arc during the period is displayed as &lsquo;B on&rsquo; while &lsquo;B off&rsquo; provides the arc distribution without any control. Without any applied magnetic field, a more random and centered arc distribution is typical. To our knowledge, this is the first time that anyone has coupled spatio-temporal control of plasma arcs using magnetic fields with an arc position measurement system as feedback to the control.</p> <p>In our efforts leading to the successful culmination of this Phase I project, we have established communications with the industry, including furnace manufacturers, material end users and, most importantly the ingot producers and have developed an industrial advisory board that includes representation from the furnace manufacturers, end users and industry consultant. The purpose of this advisory board is to ensure that our technology is relevant to their needs and to provide considerations for scalability.</p> <p>Although this proof of concept effort was successful in demonstrating the ability to provide spatio-temporal control of plasma arcs, there are a number of questions yet to be solved in a Phase II effort, some of which include effects created by the introduction of a liquid pool (liquid-metal interface); Lorentz forces within the liquid pool; effects of coaxial vs non-coaxial furnace configurations; and the development of a functional magnetic field generator capable of being deployed on an industrial furnace; Ultimately, in a Phase IIb or Phase III, the VAC needs to be evaluated against ingot quality measures and defect prediction in an industrial setting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/05/2018<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;E&nbsp;King</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1647655/1647655_10466686_1515194698383_ProjectOutcomeFig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1647655/1647655_10466686_1515194698383_ProjectOutcomeFig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="AA 383 on Fire"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1647655/1647655_10466686_1515194698383_ProjectOutcomeFig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="AA 383 on Fire"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1 - AA 383 engine failure, O-Hare airport Chicago, October 28th, 2016.</div> <div class="imageCredit">CBS News</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paul&nbsp;E&nbsp;King</div> <div class="imageTitle">AA 383 on Fire</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1647655/1647655_10466686_1515194944352_ProjectOutcomeFig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1647655/1647655_10466686_1515194944352_ProjectOutcomeFig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Validation of arc position measurements"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1647655/1647655_10466686_1515194944352_ProjectOutcomeFig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Validation of arc position measurements"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2 - Comparison between arc locations determined via VARmetricTM and image analysis.
