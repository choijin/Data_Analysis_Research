<AbstractNarration>This project will support a workshop to bring together prominent researchers, practitioners, and funders of Computer Science (CS) Education to define the initial agenda for the research and evaluation to accompany the implementation of computer science in every school in New York City (CSNYC).  With a 10-year commitment to provide computer science to every student in every school in NYC, New York is at the forefront of a national movement to increase participation in CS education at the K-12 level. Throughout the workshop, CSNYC representatives will be documenting conversations, encouraging groups to describe priorities, and looking for opportunities to not only assess the work in NYC, but also to inform the larger national K-12 CS movement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop's outcomes focus on evaluation of the expansion of CS Education in NYC and the research that will accompany the CS Education implementation. Using results from this workshop CSNYC will build consensus around key education issues such as teacher training, student outcomes, and curricular implementations. With regards to education research, CSNYC is: identifying and prioritizing topics for research; constructing a roadmap for longitudinal outcomes and necessary data collections; and defining ways in which CSNYC can support the research community in pursuing the research agenda over the course of the expansion of CS Education in NYC. Also, the outcomes of this workshop will help inform initiatives to expand computer science across the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Computer science (CS) education is rapidly expanding in the United States. Grassroots efforts in cities such as Chicago and New York, as well as states such as Arkansas, were echoed in a national call to action to provide "Computer Science for All" in K-12 schools and districts. CSNYC has undertaken a 10-year partnership with the NYC Mayor?s Office and NYC Department of Education to provide CS to every student in every school in NYC, putting the city at the forefront of a national movement to increase participation in CS education at the K-12 level. NYC?s CS4All initiative (www.cs4all.nyc) also presents a unique opportunity to advance a larger CS education research agenda. To that end, CSNYC engaged many of the most prominent researchers, practitioners, and funders of CS education to define an initial agenda for the research and evaluation to accompany the implementation of CS in every school in NYC.

Throughout the day, CSNYC representatives documented conversations, encouraged groups to describe priorities, solicited feedback and looked for opportunities not only to assess the work in NYC, but also to inform the larger national movement. The CSNYC Knowledge Forum had the goal of convening a national meeting of CS education researchers and evaluators with a focus on the evaluation of CS education, using NYC?s CS4All initiative as a case study, in order to: (1) build consensus around priority issues such as teacher training, student outcomes, and curricular implementations; (2) prioritize topics for research in CS education; (3) clarify key considerations for internal evaluations for continuous program improvement; and (4) define ways in which CSNYC can support the research community in pursuing the research agenda over the course of the CS4All initiative.
