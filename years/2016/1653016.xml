<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;Luminescence is present in our daily life, e.g., from electronic screens and lighting to medical imaging. It affects energy conservation, health and security. Luminescence is generated in several ways, in particular by ionizing radiation. Likewise, luminescent materials are used for the detection and measurement of ionizing radiation, e.g., scintillators and dosimeters. This research promotes the development of enhanced luminescent materials positively affecting life and society through the discovery and development of more efficient sensors for ionizing radiation. It also supports the integration between research, training and education; outreach towards underrepresented minority groups; and enhancement of educational infrastructure in high schools in South Carolina. Specifically, it aims at increasing the awareness of materials science and engineering to high school students as a relevant and attractive professional path, and the development of resources and strategies to incorporate fundamental concepts of materials science and engineering into science classes in high school. Materials science and engineering graduates commonly find employment in advanced materials and engineered components industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: &lt;br/&gt;The performance of scintillators and dosimeters is related to, among other things, the presence of electronic traps that correspond to localized energy levels within the band gap generated by defects like vacancies, interstitials, impurities, etc. This project is the first comprehensive investigation that relates characteristics of luminescent materials such as chemical composition and crystallographic structure to the specific characteristics of electronic traps. Within this context, the goals of this project include the investigation of relationships between the structure of families of materials and dopants with the nature and characteristics of their electronic traps and their luminescent/scintillating properties, as well as guided discovery of new compositions and development of luminescent materials in diverse forms to answer for scintillating and dosimetric needs. Given the serendipitous nature of the discovery of scintillators and dosimeters to date, this project offers an innovative and transformative approach toward engineering electronic traps in luminescent materials to guide discovery, create functionality, and enhance performance of dosimeters and scintillators. Within this research, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in cutting-edge research methods and techniques related to synthesis, processing, and characterization of inorganic luminescent materials.</AbstractNarration>
