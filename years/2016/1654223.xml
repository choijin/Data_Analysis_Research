<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Corinna Schindler at the University of Michigan.  Her research group is developing new synthetic methods for the rapid synthesis of naturally occurring complex molecules of biological importance. The research described seeks to develop sustainable methods using either environmentally benign metal-mediated or metal-free processes for the synthesis of structures with multiple rings. Such structures are difficult to access using currently available synthetic technologies. The focus on organic synthesis is an integral component of Professor Schindler's educational plans, which include training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, both in large introductory science classes and in her research laboratory. She also is involved in outreach programs designed to engage Detroit middle school students to spark and sustain an interest in natural product research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the research project is to address the challenge of selective carbon-carbon bond formation in complex systems. Professor Schindler's studies are establishing new synthetic approaches to enable direct access to two classes of important building blocks. Specifically, her group is developing a formal carbon dianion linchpin strategy to yield polycyclic 1,3-dione building blocks common to many biologically active target structures. The linchpin strategy provides a one-step alternative to multi-step sequences relying on harsh reaction conditions. Additionally, her group is developing a metal-free, catalytic method to access desirable structural motifs bearing quaternary carbons in a diastereoselective fashion. Together, these new strategies enable the synthesis of complex, polycyclic molecules. The objectives described complement and advance currently existing synthetic methods to enable rapid and efficient access to carbocyclic structures of biological importance. Professor Schindler's outreach includes a "Natural Products in Bloom" program developed with the Matthaei Botanical Gardens in Ann Arbor that is designed to stimulate interest and positive public perception of synthetic organic chemistry in the general public.</AbstractNarration>
