<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research funds this award on theoretical research and education in the physics of strongly interacting electron systems. The study of emergent properties in these systems, i.e. properties that the system displays as a whole but which are not characteristic of the constituents, is one of the central thrusts of theoretical physics, and currently a key area of inquiry in a broad range of subfields including condensed matter, string theory and quantum gravity, cold-atom condensates, and quantum information theory. More generally, quantum materials play an increasingly important role in a range of more applied sciences, so increased understanding of these problems has the potential to influence broader developments in science and technology as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical work in this field ranges from highly focused "microscopic" studies that attempt to provide a quantitative understanding of specific properties of particular interesting materials, to more abstract studies of simple models that shed light on the possible qualitative behaviors of quantum materials.  The bulk of the work that will be supported by this award is of the latter variety.  Both analytic and newly developed numerical methods will be deployed to compute the equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of paradigmatic models of many interacting electrons.  That knowledge could enable qualitative contact with measured properties of materials that have so far proven too complex to be understood from a more microscopic perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the proposed research will be carried out in collaboration with PhD students and post-doctoral scholars.  The combination of theoretical precision and phenomenological relevance of the proposed studies makes them ideal for training future condensed matter theorists, and more generally for producing scholars able to grapple with complex, open-ended problems in a broad range of venues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research funds this award on theoretical research and education in the physics of strongly interacting electron systems. One of the striking characteristics of systems of strongly interacting electrons is the complex interplay between competing or coexisting forms of order including magnetism, superconductivity, and electronic liquid crystalline order. Understanding the inter-relations between these ordering tendencies and the fluctuations associated with them may well be the key to understanding the physics of highly correlated quantum materials, including various high-temperature superconductors. Many aspects of the emergent low-energy physics of such materials are qualitatively similar despite their chemical and structural diversity. In the vicinity of a zero temperature quantum critical point (where an electronic order onsets as a function of an external tuning parameter), the microscopic physics is averaged out, giving rise to universal scaling behavior. More generally, many of the materials of interest show surprisingly simple scaling laws, such as a linear dependence of the resistivity on temperature, over broad regimes which may or may not be influenced by a "nearby" quantum critical point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the PI will undertake a theoretical investigation of the qualitative aspects of the interplay of order and fluctuations in correlated materials. The work will focus on simple models that can illuminate the generic behavior of systems of strongly correlated electrons.  Among the directions to be pursued are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) methods will be employed to study models of interacting electrons that do not suffer from the fermion minus sign problem, and can thus be solved efficiently in a broad range of temperatures and system sizes. A large part of the effort will be devoted to models of quantum criticality in metallic systems. In addition, the problem of electrons interacting strongly with phonons, which is at the heart of the physics of conventional superconductors, will be revisited in order to understand, among other things, what limits the maximum superconducting transition temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Novel regimes of electron transport, not described by the traditional nearly-free-electron theory of metals, will be investigated. In particular, the PI will identify regimes in which electrons in solids behave hydrodynamically, i.e. as a locally-equilibrated collective "fluid" with a nearly-conserved momentum and energy. In addition, the "bad metal" transport regime, where the resistivity of a material is too high to be accounted for by a model of nearly-independent quasi-particles, will be explored in simple theoretical models that can be controlled in certain limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the proposed research will be carried out in collaboration with PhD students and post-doctoral scholars.  The combination of theoretical precision and phenomenological relevance of the proposed studies makes them ideal for training future condensed matter theorists, and more generally for producing scholars able to grapple with complex, open-ended problems in a broad range of venues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the pillars of theoretical physics is the Migdal-Eliashberg theory of the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations in metals.  Not only does this theory underlie most of the generally accepted theory of such normal state properties of metals as their resistivity and more generally their behavior in the presence of electro-magnetic fields, but it also underlies the famous Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity.  For the past 60 years, it has been the basis of all quantitative attempts to understand the physics governing the transition temperature, Tc, to the superconducting state.  However, while there are a number of highly plausible arguments used to justify the validity of the approximations that underlie this approach, there have also been reasons to question whether its regime of validity is really as broad as has been generally claimed.  Moreover, an implication of this approach is that by finding materials with ever stronger coupling between the electrons and the lattice vibrations, it should be possible to increase the Tc of such "conventional superconductors" without bound - a notion that seems phenomenologically incompatible with what is observed in studies of the properties of known superconducting materials.  In a series of papers supported by the present grant, we seriously explored the underpinnings of this approach.  Firstly, we identified a simple, computationally well-defined model problem that could be solved using methods of quantum statistical mechanics employing a computational approach known as determinental quantum Monte Carlo to obtain an exact solution of the model problem.  We then solved the same problem using the approximate Migdal-Eliashberg approach and compared the two in a way that could be done unambiguously, without any adjustable parameters.  We found that as long as the coupling between electrons and the lattice vibrations is not too strong, the approximate results are remarkably accurate.  However, contrary to what was previously believed, we found that if the coupling is not sufficiently weak, the Migdal-Eliashberg approach produces results that are both quantitatively and qualitatively wrong.  Among other thing, we found empirically that there is an upper bound on the value of Tc possible from this sort of interaction, and that stronger interactions with the lattice quench superconductivity rather than leading to higher Tcs.  (We also presented analytic arguments which give an intuitive explanation for why this occurs.)    In addition to the intellectual importance of this set of results, they have considerable practical importance for the search for new and better superconductors.  These results imply that only by finding materials that have higher frequency lattice vibrations (as do, for example, the recently studied high pressure superconducting hydrides) is it possible to find conventional superconductors with significantly higher values of Tc than those of existing superconductors. Other than this, it is only by looking to "unconventtional superconductors" -- superconductors in which the strongly correlated motion of the electrons themselves are the primary mechanism of superconductivity -- can one hope to find higher Tcs.  Another significant accomplishment funded by this grant was a coauthored review of the physics of spin-liquids, recently published in Science Magazine. The attached figure is from this paper -- it is a schematic representation of what is known as an emergent gauge theory which is now recognized as the most effective way to characterize this new class of quantum phases of matter.  As we discuss in this paper, the theory of these phases is now well established.  A variety of model problems have been proven to have such ground-state phases, and there are a number of precisely constructed effective field theories that capture the essential emergent physics of these phases.  What is still unclear is where these phases exist in nature.  However, there are now a large number of "spin-liquid-candidate materials" -- materials which exhibit properties that are suggestive of a spin-liquid ground state.  In our paper we also review explicitly such evidence  in several of the most promising candidate materials, and discuss what needs to be done to definitively settle the issue of whether or not they are  spin-liquids.
