<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Dispersive partial differential equations (PDE) describe many aspects of the physical world. Their solutions exhibit wave-like behavior and can be represented as a combination of traveling waves, with each wave moving at a frequency-dependent velocity. Consequently, a solution which is initially concentrated somewhere will eventually disperse as its constituent waves move apart from each other. The Schrodinger equation from quantum mechanics and the wave equation from acoustics and electrodynamics are among the simplest representatives of dispersive PDE. For any equation purporting to model nature, it is important to understand its mathematical properties precisely. For instance, does it even have solutions? How do its solutions look like over time? Do they decay, or increase in magnitude? Do solutions remain stable if the initial conditions are disturbed slightly? These are not merely academic questions; for instance, since measurements always involve some degree of uncertainty, an equation whose solutions diverge wildly under small changes of the initial condition is probably not a very realistic model. Mathematicians have sought to answer these questions in great detail for the Schrodinger equation, wave equation, and more challenging variants called nonlinear Schrodinger equations (NLS) and nonlinear wave equations (NLW). These already constitute a large family of equations, and one goal of studying them is to develop techniques and insights that shed light on more intricate dispersive equations, such as models of water waves or Einstein’s field equations from general relativity. To date, the clearest pictures are available for NLS and NLW with constant coefficients. This means that the equations assume that space and time have infinite extent and are homogeneous, devoid of any external forces. There are two reasons to study such idealized equations, one philosophical and one technical. Firstly, there is no point in studying more complicated equations if one cannot handle easy cases. Also, the assumption of homogeneity makes the equations ripe for attack using powerful tools from a branch of mathematics called harmonic analysis. Indeed, harmonic analysis techniques powered many breakthroughs in dispersive PDE over the last thirty years. This project explored the less well-traveled field of NLS and NLW with variable coefficients. No longer do we assume that spacetime looks the same everywhere; on the contrary, we consider equations such as the NLS with a harmonic oscillator potential, which is used to model Bose-Einstein condensates under laser confinement. Throughout our work, we encountered the recurring theme that while the ideas from the previous works are likely valid, their techniques are ill-adapted to the more general equations that we consider. In three peer-reviewed papers, we considered three different equations: the energy-critical NLS on a curved background, the mass-critical NLS with a harmonic oscillator potential, and (together with Cristian Gavrus and Daniel Tataru) the wave maps system on a Lorentzian manifold. In each case, the constant-coefficient case of the equation was already understood, and we sought to gain comparable insights into the more general case. In doing so, we developed new techniques and estimates to handle the new geometry. We hope to see our methods further expanded and refined in future work.
