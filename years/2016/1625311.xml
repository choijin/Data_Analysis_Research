<AbstractNarration>Dr. Danica Roth has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at the University of Oregon and Vanderbilt University. The primary objective of this study is to establish and enhance the applicability of the nonlocal sediment transport numerical model in real landscapes. Nonlocal sediment transport processes include bioturbation by tree throw and burrowing animals, and fire-induced ravel. The project is composed of several distinct but complementary modules with a range of experimental, field- and data-driven components, and it naturally lends itself to outreach, education and mentorship at the K-12 and undergraduate-level. Dr. Roth will establish a new chapter of the NSF-funded Institute for Science and Engineer Educators' Professional Development Program at the University of Oregon, which will provide graduate students and postdocs with training in equitable, inquiry-based pedagogy. This program will be a venue to design a new field-based inquiry activity utilizing data from this study. The activity will be taught in the Hillslope Geomorphology class at the University of Oregon and made publicly available in online educational archives. The social relevance of topics encompassed by this project (e.g., erosional responses to fires and clear cutting) will also generate public interest and provide opportunities to increase awareness of these issues through public lectures, popular press pieces, and educational content published on YouTube and our web pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bridge the gap between the well-developed theoretical work on nonlocal transport and the need for field-based measurements and applications of nonlocal transport. This study will also generate valuable datasets on particle transport distances in a wide range of natural field settings. The nonlocal transport model will address one of the major weaknesses of existing models by taking into account roughness. The effects of roughness will be incorporated into the nonlocal formulation for particle disentrainment via its influence on critical slope and the probabilistic spacing of roughness elements. A modified PØclet number for the relative importance of local and nonlocal transport processes will be developed and field-tested in a range of natural settings. All analyses and theory will be informed and tested with field experiments to compare theoretical and measured particle travel distances and erosion rates in the Oregon Coast Range and the Painted Hills badlands in Central Oregon.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit/Outcomes:  Steeplands contribute disproportionately to the flux of sediment, carbon, and nutrients across Earth?s surface, and much of the active sediment transport on Earth&mdash;especially high-magnitude events such as landslides and responses to disturbances like wildfire, land use or climate change&mdash;involves steepland processes. Developing predictive models for event-driven steepland dynamics is therefore particularly urgent in view of forecasted changes in climate and predicted increases in wildfire frequency due to prolonged drought conditions and intensifying winter storms on the west coast of the US.  Most transport models, however, use approaches unable to capture the long-distance particle motions characteristic of steeplands. This represents a crucial gap in our ability to predict erosion and hazards in steep settings. Probabilistic "nonlocal" models may close this gap, but experimental data have been needed to make them work in real landscapes. Without this data, previous theoretical work has focused either on small-scale models of particle motion built on simplified physics, or on predicting long-term, average landscape evolution based on statistics assumptions. Our work provides this much-needed experimental data, as well as a mathematically straightforward yet experimentally consistent model framework with the potential to unify these two realms of sediment transport theory.  Specifically, our work examines how far sediment travels on densely forested, rough hillslopes and slopes that were recently smoothed by wildfire in western Oregon. Our work:  1) reveals a key control on steepland and post-fire sediment transport by demonstrating both that surface roughness is highly efficient at slowing or stopping mobile particles, and that wildfire is highly effective at removing surface roughness from landscapes;  2) provides detailed methods for examining surface roughness using dense topographic data point clouds in heavily vegetated areas and for experimentally assessing local particle travel statistics;  3) demonstrates that landscapes dominated by nonlocal sediment transport evolve in ways that may be fundamentally different than those dominated by short-distance sediment transport processes; and  3) allows the broader application of nonlocal models by providing a starting framework for representing how far sediment travels depending on the topography and measurable site characteristics.        The data and conceptual framework we provide are key to developing more precise and scale-independent applications of nonlocal models needed to predict erosion rates and landscape evolution in today?s rapidly changing world. For example, our results indicate that decreased surface roughness following wildfires could drastically affect the grain size distributions entering streams downslope of recently burned regions. Particle transport statistics such as those provided by our work can help us use nonlocal sediment transport models to directly assess how much sediment will move in a given setting independent of process or scale.
