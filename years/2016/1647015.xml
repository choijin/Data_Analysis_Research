<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the problem of urban transportation and congestion by directly engaging individual commuters. Because of the widespread use of smart devices, users are modeled as active agents in a shared economy, with algorithms designed to incentivize them to take actions that are efficient for the overall transportation system.  Many commercially available Internet of Things solutions for multimodal transit focus on what is best for each individual from his or her local perspective. As the number of these local solutions grows, the misalignment between objectives of individual and the overall system also grows. An information bottleneck also forms, since massive data is collected by municipalities and users, but neither has the resources to develop real-time analytics and controls. Currently, very little has been done to provide an overarching solution that balances the needs of multiple parties, including commercial companies, municipal service providers, and individuals.  The project will configure a computing and information sharing platform that overcomes the incentive gap between individuals and municipalities. This platform offers mixed-mode routing suggestions and general system information to travelers and in turn provides service providers with high-fidelity information about how users are consuming transportation resources. The platform also help to improve community engagement in policy and regulatory decisions by serving as a virtual commons where individual citizens can connect to municipal service providers. The platform will be suitable for application to any smart city and will be tested in Seattle, WA and Nashville, TN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda divides into three key thrusts: 1) a hierarchical optimization architecture amenable to implementation on a distributed platform; 2) a mechanism design framework for recruiting resources from strategic users and incentivizing mixed-mode routes; 3) a software defined networking supported social computing platform that utilizes edge devices for computation. The proposed research extends existing optimization techniques for solving the multimodal transit problem by incorporating probabilistic representations of events, creating a near-optimal distributed algorithm by employing submodularity, and folding in incentive mechanisms into the optimization problem. In addition, the results will significantly advance the theory of mechanism design by developing novel adaptive contracting and incentive mechanisms in a societal setting. Real world experimental trials will be conducted with the support of municipal and industry partners to validate the platform and supporting algorithms.</AbstractNarration>

The specific outcomes were the following,   Mechanisms for Outsourcing Computation via a Decentralized Market (MODiCuM) - MODiCuM is a decentralized system for outsourcing computation. MODiCuM deters participants from misbehaving-which is a key problem in decentralized systems-by resolving disputes via dedicated mediators and by imposing enforceable fines. However, unlike other decentralized outsourcing solutions, MODiCuM minimizes computational overhead since it does not require global trust in mediation results.   Mobilytics Routing Framework- An Extensible, Modular and Resilient Mobility Platform: A central component of a transportation management platform is the mobility planning application. Given the societal relevance of these platforms, it is necessary to ensure that they operate resiliently. Modularity and extensibility are also critical properties that are required for manageability. Modularity allows isolating faults easily. Extensibility enables the update of policies and integration of new mobility modes or new routing algorithms. However, state of the art mobility planning applications like the open-trip planner, are monolithic applications, which makes it difficult to scale and modify them dynamically. Through the project, we were able to develop a proof of concept microservices based modular multi-modal mobility platform Mobilytics, that integrates mobility providers, commuters, and community stakeholders.   Mobilytics-Gym: A Simulation Framework for Analyzing Urban Mobility Decision Strategies -  Through the project we were able to extend MATSim, an agent-based simulation framework, to integrate agent preference models that capture the altruistic behavior of an agent in addition to their disutility proportional to the travel time and cost. These models are learned in a data-driven approach and can be used to evaluate the sensitivity of an agent to system-level disutility and monetary incentives given, e.g., by the transportation authority. This framework provides a standardized environment to evaluate the effectiveness of any particular incentive policy of a city, in nudging its residents towards alternate modes of transportation.    Decentralized Routing Algorithms: Route planning is a well-studied topic, however, the current state of the art route planning algorithms have developed in line with the cloud environments in which they run and are therefore optimized for a centralized approach. In this model, parallelization of the search algorithm uses a shared memory model. Hence, its deployment is limited to a multiprocessing environment such as in a data center, where it is assumed that a shared memory allows constant time direct communication between each pair of processors. It is not well suited for a distributed setting.  As a contrarian approach, we have developed a resilient, decentralized route planning approach for time-dependent transportation networks. Our approach handles all routing at the network edge within a decentralized computing framework.  The key results of this work are a grid partitioning strategy that divides the city into grids, the development of an approximate distributed algorithm to map the route planning queries into a hierarchical search algorithm over the grid, and the development of a federated learning algorithm to collaboratively learn the travel time distribution across the grids.    Public Transit and Micromobility Analysis Algorithms: Through the project, we developed solutions to manage the datasets related to public transit and micromobility applications in the city. This enabled us to develop algorithms to study and optimized the performance of public transit and also enabled us to develop algorithms for studying the transportation impact of public transit and micromobility devices such as electrical scooters.    Broader Impacts of the Project: A core aspect of this project was the data integration into and computation of analytics within our platform.
