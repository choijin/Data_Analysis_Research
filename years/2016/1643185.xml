<AbstractNarration>This project focusses on equation solving in Algebra I for seventh and eighth grade students. This research extends research on an on-going project on developing an on-line, game-like learning environment called APLUS (Artificial Peer Learning environment Using SimStudent) in which students learn by teaching a synthetic peer called SimStudent. Learning by teaching is an exciting and innovative approach to learning and instruction that is often reported to be effective in classroom trials. However, little is known about the underlying cognitive and social theory on how and when students learn by teaching. Although some studies have shown a potential for scale learning by teaching through implementation in technology, very little is known about the transformative theory to successfully implement learning by teaching. To address this issue, the researchers build on their current work to further develop the theory of learning by teaching and to understand how best to achieve the theory development through advanced technology support. The researchers also investigate the similarities and differences between learning by teaching and learning by being tutored to better engineer effective advanced learning technology. In particular, the researchers propose to improve the effectiveness of APLUS by providing adaptive scaffolding for students to teach SimStudent correctly and appropriately. The researchers also propose to collect detailed process data that show fine-grained interactions between the student and SimStudent in addition to outcome data, which are test scores. By combining the process and outcome data, the researchers will explore the cognitive and social theory of learning by teaching. The researchers hypothesize that providing help on how to solve problems (cognitive help) and how to tutor (metacognitive help) will facilitate tutor learning. They also conjecture that the interaction between cognitive and metacognitive help will yield a rich learning environment that, in combination with the unique characteristics of learning by teaching, will be more effective than learning by being tutored. The following research questions will be addressed:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Q1: Does cognitive help facilitate tutor learning? If so, how and why?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Q2: Does metacognitive help facilitate tutor learning? If so, how and why?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q3: Is learning by teaching with the meta-tutor assistance better than learning by being tutored?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Learning by teaching has been widely recognized to be effective for academically challenging populations, including African American students and underprivileged students. Therefore, the proposed intervention, if proven to be effective, would contribute to the development of effective STEM learning support system for all students regardless of their race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, or geographical locale in contemporary US classrooms. Since the entire proposed technology would run as a web-based application, the software products will be distributed widely and rapidly. The study data will be shared through the opendata repository, DataShop, under the direct supervision of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Thus, the research effort will contribute to the general learning research community by providing that community opportunities to conduct secondary data analyses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Award Title: Learning by Teaching a Synthetic Peer: Investigating the effect of tutor scaffolding for tutor learning  Award No: 1643185  Report Submission Period: 10/1/2013 to 9/30/2017     The goal of this project is to advance the theory of learning by teaching, a well-known phenomenon that students learn by teaching their peer. This project builds on our previous project where we had built a machine-learning agent, aka a teachable agent, that interactively learn skills to solve problems, and also developed an online learning environment, called APLUS (Artificial Peer Learning environment Using SimStudent) where students learn to solve linear algebra equations by teaching SimStudent.     During our previous project, we often observed that students had trouble teaching their teachable agents due to the lack of knowledge in solving equations (which is not a surprise--they were learning how to solve equations) hence they did not benefit from teaching.  Therefore, for the current project, we are particularly interested in investigating the effect of adaptive scaffolding while students are teaching.     We hypothesized that providing scaffolding on how to solve problems (cognitive scaffolding) and how to tutor (metacognitive scaffolding) would facilitate tutor learning. To test this hypothesis, we developed a tutor-agent, often called meta-tutor, and integrated it into APLUS. The meta-tutor monitors a student teaching his/her teachable agent, and provides adaptive scaffolding both on-demand and proactively. For the cognitive scaffolding, the meta-tutor tells the student the correctness of solutions proposed by the synthetic peer and how to solve the problem. For the metacognitive scaffolding, the meta-tutor tells the student when to have the synthetic peer take a quiz, what problem should be taught next, and when to review learning resources.     We also hypothesized that the appearance of cognitive and metacognitive scaffolding would yield a rich learning environment that, in combination with the unique characteristics of learning by teaching, would be more efficient than cognitive tutoring, a well-known effective style of learning.     To test these hypotheses, we have conducted classroom studies where we compared the effectiveness of learning by teaching with and without the adaptive scaffolding (i.e., cognitive and metacognitive scaffolding).  We also compared learning by teaching with adaptive scaffolding with learning by being tutored (i.e., cognitive tutoring).     Highlights of the study results include the following: (1) Metacognitive scaffolding amplifies the effect of learning by teaching more than cognitive scaffolding.  The presence of cognitive scaffolding is rather detrimental for learning by teaching.  (2) With the presence of metacognitive scaffolding, students tend to show an ideal use of the quiz as a formative assessment and select problems to teach next accordingly, which arguably increases the effect of learning by teaching.  (3) Learning by teaching with adaptive metacognitive scaffolding is as effective as cognitive tutoring.     Throughout this project, we have demonstrated that our technology innovations, the teachable agent (SimStudent) and the online learning environment for learning by teaching (APLUS) are robust enough to be used in authentic classroom settings. We also demonstrated that the learning technologies can be used to collect data to advance the theory of how people learn.
