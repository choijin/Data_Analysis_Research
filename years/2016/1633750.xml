<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate multi-sensory visual and tactile interfaces for understanding complex spatial data.  The project will contribute new insights to an emerging interdisciplinary research thrust involving geography and other spatial sciences, geoscience education, cartographic visualization, and cognitive psychology that examines how the dimensionality of a topographic map affects map users' ability to understand and apply spatial information.  By comparing cognitive load and learning effects on the basis of dimensionality, the project will help identify the role spatial ability plays in supporting comprehension of map data and what instructional strategies may be appropriate for varied levels of dimensionality.  The project will help improve spatial thinking abilities through the development of engaging instructional strategies and hands-on use of the innovative technologies in order to better prepare students for success in science, technology, education, and mathematics (STEM) careers.  The project's research on multi-sensor interfaces will support further inquiry into the role of dimensionality as a factor in spatial thinking to advance STEM education that potentially can benefit a broad range of users but will have special value for kinesthetic learners and visually impaired individuals because of greater emphasis on interactive, tactile features of multi-sensory instruction.  The source code and resources for teaching spatial skills from a subsequent map-reading instructional module will be made readily accessible to assist others in improving STEM educational capabilities.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent innovations in three-dimensional (3-D) geovisual and tactile interactive displays can facilitate multi-sensory learning.  While the presentation of mapped landscapes using two-dimensional (2-D) topographic contour lines for a map user requires transfer of abstract 2-D spatial data to visual the 3-D world, the augmented-reality sandbox, a 3-D tangible user-interface, enables users to touch and manipulate 3-D map surfaces in real-time.  Learning is multi-sensory, because interactive tactile feedback complements visual feedback, but previous studies disagree about the learning effect of varying the dimension in which spatial information is presented.  During the conduct of this study, the doctoral student will use an experimental design to assess the effect of map dimensionality on learning performance scores and on mental effort while controlling for differences in spatial thinking ability and gender.  He will measure prior spatial thinking ability of research subjects using two widely used spatial ability tests, the mental rotations test and the paper-folding test.  Geoscience undergraduate students will be placed into different groups based on their gender and will be randomly assigned to receive instruction conveyed through one of the three topographic map interfaces:  the 3-D augmented-reality sandbox; a 2.5-D geovisual computer interface through which a 3-D image is superimposed on a 2-D computer screen; or a 2-D printed map.  This research design will focus on ascertaining whether and how map dimensionality influences participants' abilities to use spatial information from topographic maps with the least amount of mental effort.  Learning performance will be assessed as each group completes a common post-test on map-reading skills.  Mental effort will be measured through the use of eye tracking analysis of pupil size and movement as correlated to participant self-ratings using the mental-effort measurement scale. Comparing interactions between mental effort and performance scores on the basis of dimensionality will identify how spatial thinking supports comprehension of topographic map profiles and what instructional and learning strategies may be appropriate for varied levels of dimensionality.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This doctoral dissertation improvement grant (#1633750) was a two-year project that resulted in Dr. R.T. Richardson&rsquo;s completed PhD research. Dr. Richardson examined whether three-dimensional, tactile, manipulable teaching technologies would be more effective for learning than traditional, two-dimensional paper media.&nbsp; Learning objectives and mental effort were both measured as indicators of effective teaching. The subject area in which these issues were tested was geosciences, specifically topographic map knowledge. The 3D technology was a large sandbox, built according to the instructions of Reid et al. (2014, cited in Richardson, 2017). Using a variety of computer-based technologies, a topographic map image was overlaid on the sandbox; this created a tactile and manipulable map. That is, as a user sculpted the sand in the sandbox, the overlay would change color, indicating changes in elevation. A participant could build a hill or mountain, create a valley or saddle, and even generate a rain shadow which would indicate the flow of water. The 2D paper map was a traditional map on which a participant could point to, but not manipulate, topographic features. Eighty-three undergraduate college students participated in the experiment. Their spatial ability was tested and determined to be either high or low. Having been sorted by spatial ability, the participants were then randomly assigned to either the 3D sandbox or 2D paper map condition.</p> <p>Both groups first received training on topographic map terms and concepts through a researcher-created multimedia module. They then moved to a learning practice activity with either the 3D sandbox or the 2D paper map on which they created 3D or 2D examples of the terms taught in the multimedia module. Their performance in the learning practice activity was recorded, as were the subjects&rsquo; evaluations of their mental effort for each question. Finally, both groups took a paper-based assessment on their knowledge of the terms and concepts.&nbsp; And mental effort scores for each item were also reported.&nbsp; In order to correlate self-reported mental effort scores with more objective measures of cognitive load, eye tracking hardware recorded information such as changes in pupil size, eye fixation on areas of the map and multimedia module, and eye movement between areas.&nbsp; The eye tracking data continue to be analyzed by Dr. Richardson.</p> <p>The results of this study (Richardson, 2017) indicate that there were no differences in either learning performance or mental effort between the two groups on the final, paper-based assessment. However, there were significant differences in performance between the two groups on the learning practice activity. The 3D sandbox group outperformed the 2D paper map group when they were able to apply their knowledge of terms and concepts on the sandbox; this was true whether the participants were high or low spatial ability. Similarly, the 3D sandbox group reported much lower mental effort scores during the learning practice activity. Importantly, the low spatial ability participants in the 3D sandbox group reported substantially lower mental effort. These results suggest that the 3D sandbox was especially effective for teaching topographic map terms and concepts to low spatial ability students: their performance was the same, but their mental effort was much lower.</p> <p>The outcomes of Dr. Richardson&rsquo;s research include demonstration of the effectiveness of the 3D sandbox as a tool for teaching terms, concepts, and skills that require three-dimensional visualization. This is important to topographic map reading, but could be extended to any STEM discipline in which students must be able to project and analyze three-dimensional objects and relationships. Additionally, Dr. Richardson&rsquo;s results indicate the degree to which the 3D sandbox supported the learning of low spatial ability students. &nbsp;His findings suggest that students with low spatial skills, such as the ability to visualize three-dimensional relationships, will performance better with less mental effort when they use 3D tactile and manipulable technology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Dorothy&nbsp;C&nbsp;Sammons</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1633750/1633750_10448001_1530303653358_sandtablemap--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1633750/1633750_10448001_1530303653358_sandtablemap--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1633750/1633750_10448001_1530303653358_sandtablemap--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">3D Sandbox base map.
