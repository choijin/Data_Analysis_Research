<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical&lt;br/&gt;This research program investigates a strategy to make solar cells dramatically more efficient, providing a route to lower-cost solar electricity.  The research examines barriers to combining the two most commercially successful photovoltaic (PV) technologies - cadmium telluride (CdTe) from the II-VI family of semiconductors and crystalline silicon (Si) solar cells - to form a tandem structure with the II-VI solar cell deposited on top of the Si cell for a much higher efficiency than either cell individually.  The fundamental scientific issues investigated will directly enable high-efficiency multijunction cells with only two electrical contacts, greatly simplifying their manufacture and lowering costs.  The program benefits society on several different levels.  On a global and national level, the high-efficiency solar cell technologies would accelerate deployment of photovoltaics - which produce over 1% of the world's electricity today - reducing greenhouse gas emission and international security concerns that accompany other electricity sources, and increasing access to electrical power for disadvantaged populations in the U.S. and around the world, while creating high-paying, high-technology U.S. jobs.  On an educational level, this cutting-edge research provides key scientific training for students from many backgrounds to give them the skills and experience necessary to enter the rapidly-growing U.S. photovoltaics workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to develop the scientific understanding needed to integrate a II-VI top cell, for example the CdMgTe alloy with 15% Mg and 1.75-eV band-gap energy, with a crystalline silicon bottom cell to form a monolithic tandem solar cell with only two terminals for ease of manufacture and use in PV modules, and with a target efficiency over 28%.  The project investigates five key scientific areas:  1) factors controlling the bulk lifetime and grain-boundary recombination of CdMgTe as its band-gap energy is increased from that of CdTe;  2) changes in semiconductor quality caused by reversing the usual growth order of II-VI cells; 3) composition, interface properties, and deposition conditions of the interconnection layers between the top and bottom cells; 4) interactions between the chemically different top and bottom cells that may degrade minority-carrier lifetime in the Si bottom cell; and 5) integration technology for demonstrating prototype 2-junction CdMgTe/Si solar cells with a target efficiency of 28%, well above the highest efficiencies of either solar cell material alone.  Areas 1 and 2 will be investigated at Colorado State University (CSU) with CdMgTe cells made with its single-vacuum, multi-source deposition system.  The quality of the CdMgTe absorber layer will be evaluated by time-resolved photoluminescence and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy.  Cells deposited with the n-type layer over the p-type CdMgTe will be primarily analyzed through standard current-voltage, quantum-efficiency, and capacitance measurements and the application of device-analysis techniques developed at CSU.  Areas 3 and 4 will be studied at Arizona State University (ASU).  Varying interconnection layer compositions and combinations will be deposited by sputtering, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and atomic-layer deposition, on high-lifetime Si cells built at ASU.  Evaluation will focus on the key metrics of electrical transport, optical transmittance, and suitability for high-quality II-VI growth on top.  Potential changes in the Si cell due to the thermal budget and recombination activity of impurities associated with top cell growth will be characterized by secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, temperature-dependent current-voltage, and inductively-coupled carrier-lifetime measurements.  Area 5, cell integration, will be accomplished jointly by the two universities with target efficiency of 28%, which would profoundly impact the penetration of solar-generated electricity in the global economy.  The value of the project, however, extends beyond photovoltaic cells, shedding light on the fundamentals of defects in low-cost polycrystalline semiconductors, and providing insight on other applications such as integration of light emitters on low-cost silicon for high-speed computing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this program is to bring together CdTe-based II-VI semiconductors and silicon - the two most widely-deployed PV technologies - into high-efficiency, low-cost tandem solar cells.  This program has demonstrated four crucial and necessary elements to integrate these solar cell materials to form monolithic 2-junction II-VI/Si solar cells:    -  Discovered that experimentally-determined carrier lifetimes in silicon substrates can be retained at levels &gt;1 millisecond after II-VI deposition, and &gt;0.4 millisecond after the critical CdCl2 post-deposition treatment for II-VI cells, consistent with II-VI/Si 2-junction cells with &gt;30% projected 1-sun efficiency.    -  Demonstrated that polycrystalline thin-film CdTe can be deposited and processed with the crucial CdCl2 post-deposition treatment on silicon solar cell substrates.    -  Demonstrated II-VI top cell back-surface field (BSF) p-ZnTe/TCO interlayer heterojunctions transparent to wavelengths transmitted by II-VI top cell, with specific interface resistivity &rho;c &lt; 0.5 &Omega;cm2, consistent with less than 0.2% loss in absolute efficiency of II-VI 2-junction cells, and demonstrated alternative BSF p-aSi (p-type amorphous Si)/TCO interlayers with measured &rho;c more than 10 times lower.    -  Constructed monolithically-integrated II-VI/Si 2-junction cells with greater measured 1-sun open-circuit voltage Voc than either the II-VI top cell or Si bottom cell alone.    These findings inform research areas that are of general importance to the fields of semiconductor materials and devices, and establish and document a foundation for future II-VI/Si 2-junction cell development.    If the successes in this program can be continued to form manufacturable high-efficiency devices, the foundations developed in this program - such as long minority-carrier lifetimes in silicon after CdTe deposition, and demonstration of low specific contact resistivity in back-surface-field (BSF) layers for CdTe cells and transparent interconnect layers for multijunction cells - could provide the basis for a new generation of solar cells, with broad impacts that are global in scope.    A game-changing efficiency increase in the dominant single-junction silicon and CdTe photovoltaic technologies is becoming increasingly challenging as these cell technologies become more mature.  Multijunction solar cells formed using these materials, however, offer a direct path to a leap in efficiency.  Higher conversion efficiency and the lower cost per kWhr of PV electricity generated can contribute significantly to making photovoltaics - a non-polluting, geographically plentiful energy source - widely available at costs low enough to displace conventional electricity sources.    Locally, the program's broader impacts are focused on education:  education for the graduate and undergraduate students directly involved in the technological work, and for the scientific community through conference presentations, invited talks, and scientific publications.  Prof. King has further developed a course on Advanced Photovoltaics at ASU, and taught it in 2017 and 2018.  II-VI solar cell architecture and materials, and high-efficiency Si solar cell device physics formed integral parts of the course content.  Prof. King also gave invited talks on "Defects, Interfaces, Surfaces, and Contacts" at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and on "Some Interesting Research Areas in Photovoltaics" at the Colorado School of Mines in 2019, on the research in this project and other topics.  The work on research related to II-VI/Si tandem cell integration, multijunction cells, and carrier-selective contacts figured prominently in these talks, and aimed to introduce these concepts to students and PV scientists at various stages of their education and professional careers.  The II-VI/Si tandem cell interlayer conductance experiments were the central theme of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) project in summer 2018 contributing to the research in the project as well as to students' professional development.    Two conference proceedings papers on this work were prepared in this program, one led by ASU graduate student Kevin Tyler on "Controlling Silicon Bottom Cell Lifetime Variance in II-VI/Si Tandems," with the work described to the PV community in an oral presentation given by ASU graduate student Madhan Kumar Arulanandam at the 2019 IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conf. (PVSC), and the other led by CSU graduate student Ramesh Pandey on "Cadmium Telluride Cells on Silicon as Precursors for Two-Junction Tandem Cells," with the work described in a poster presentation at the 2020 PVSC.  This research project also resulted in a journal article, "Silicon Degradation in Monolithic II-VI/Si Tandem Solar Cells" led by ASU graduate student Kevin Tyler, in the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics.  All three papers serve as examples of ASU and CSU collaboration in the project, with students and faculty from both schools contributing.  All three papers gave the student authors the opportunity interact with their photovoltaics colleagues across the globe, describing their scientific thought processes throughout months of work on their experiments, building their confidence as researchers, and developing their ability to exchange ideas with other scientists, skills which they will carry with them into their careers after graduate school.
