<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project comes from addressing a demand in many parts of the world for a scalable technological solution for managers of nature resources to deal with human-animal conflicts and rapid deforestation. Natural resources have large and sometimes surprising ecosystem impact. Even the direct economic value of individual wildlife and forest reserves is often in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Operationally relevant protection technologies that are sustainable can serve as an import tool in effective management. Having a low total cost of ownership and effectively co-existing with conventional human surveillance methods is key to sustainability. We seek to commercialize a protection system that is sustainable as it offers low cost, long lived devices, ease of use and maintenance, robust performance across diverse natural environments, and stealthy operation. It also augments accountability of the guards, and automates tasks such as notifying management and sharing forensic evidence of incidents in settings where communication infrastructure is not readily available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project addresses the challenge with reducing energy consumption for our battery powered, radar device based, mesh network solution for persistent, time-sensitive protection of natural resources. Commercial impact for the proposed system can only be realized if the sensor is low-power, the data driven machine learning based signal processing is low-power, and the wide area networking is low-power. Addressing all these will unlock commercial value, but the impact is limited by the least efficient part of the system. Today the radar's efficiency is the essential bottleneck in system performance; it consumes about 40 milliWatts (mW). Reducing the radar's consumption to 5mW would double, and reducing it to 1mW would at least triple, the time between battery changes. The proposed effort would design, implement, and validate power reduction in the radar subsystem and integrate the result into an overall system. The largest technical risk in the plan is the Radio Frequency subsystem, which will therefore be addressed in Phase I. Phase II will implement power reductions in all the other radar subsystems, integrate the results into a coherent sensor, and integrate that sensor into the overall system. This integration into the larger system will also deal with whole system optimizations.</AbstractNarration>

However, this assumption reveals a widespread misunderstanding.&nbsp; Video surveillance systems are low power compared to buildings and cars but are prohibitively high power for battery powered systems that need to operate in locations where human touch can only occur a few times a year.&nbsp; This project resolved several technical barriers to using ground-based radars to construct a battery powered security system suitable for the natural resource protection problem.</p> <p>As part of this effort we received guidance about efficient tactics, from &ldquo;rangers&rdquo; tasked with protecting natural resources, including military officials in Zimbabwe.&nbsp; The common, and typically preferred, way of stopping poachers is to patrol a perimeter looking for signs (i.e., tracks) that a human has crossed the perimeter.&nbsp; Once an ingress is detected, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are used to limit the ability of the intruder(s) to move quickly without revealing their location, while a tracking and &ldquo;SWAT&rdquo; (Special Weapons and Tactics) team is assembled and dispatched. &nbsp;Success depends strongly on not allowing the intruder too much of a head start.&nbsp; Currently delays of an hour or two from intrusion to detection are considered good.&nbsp; However, achieving this response time requires a substantial number of highly skilled trackers continually patrolling the perimeter.</p> <p>The system developed here will provide real time detection (i.e., delays of less than 60 seconds).&nbsp; This should radically improve performance while dramatically reducing the required number of highly skilled trackers.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p>PIR (Pyroelectric IR) sensors provide too little information, making it impossible to simultaneously achieve good FAR (False Alarm Rates) and high probabilities of detection in dynamic outdoor settings.&nbsp; Video cameras provide too much information requiring significant power just to move the data and even more power for the sophisticated image processing software. &nbsp;The low power Doppler radars used here provide about the right amount of information for this problem.</p> <p>A radar that produces complex Doppler outputs can separate positive Doppler frequencies from negative, separating motion towards the radar from motion away from the radar.&nbsp; Using this type of sensor, it is possible to construct a displacement detector, which integrates motion over time, rather than the more typical motion detector.&nbsp; The radar produced in this project facilitated a displacement detector that reduced false alarms caused by brush blowing back and forth in the wind to levels on the order of one per year.</p> <p>Reducing the FAR this much raised new questions.&nbsp; For example, if a deer is detected, is that a failure of the displacement detector or the correct detection of a target that just happens not to be of interest.&nbsp; This project used micro-Doppler and ML (Machine Learning) to differentiate wildlife from humans.&nbsp; That is, it used a spectrogram to separate the instantaneous motion of the various parts of the body and then used machine learning to recognized various patterns such as the number of limbs in use by the target.</p> <p>In a spectrally limited system it makes sense to keep the radios on all the time, to minimize the amount of the spectrum that goes unused.&nbsp; But energy optimization is achieved by communicating in bursts at faster bit rates and allowing the radios to sleep the rest of the time.&nbsp; This project used distributed time synchronization so that each node could attempt to communicate with other nodes only at the precise moment when they were awake.</p> <p>Rangers indicated that this system would be most useful in locations that are 10 to 30 km from the nearest cellular service.&nbsp; It is hard (but not theoretically impossible) to transmit this distance from a low power device. &nbsp;But because energy per bit is proportional to the square of the distance, using 10 hops each 1 to 3 km (instead of one long hop) reduces the peak power 100x and the system wide energy per bit by 10x.&nbsp;
