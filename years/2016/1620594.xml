<AbstractNarration>Paleomagnetic (i.e. fossil magnetism) data are the unique source of observations to understand the geomagnetic transitions and hence the geodynamo processes involved in field generation. Due to the fact that there is a need to obtain reversal records from volcanic sequences in order to have a better understanding of the generation of the Earth's magnetic field, it is proposed to study a long sequence (about ~191 meters) of lavas from the island Oahu, Hawaii at a site known as Makapuu Point, Koolau Volcano with the main objective of investigating the full range of paleomagnetic signals recorded before during and after several successive polarity transitions. The section covering ~410,000 years of field changes includes the possibility of studying the detailed recording of the successive magnetic field reversals such as the Gauss-Matuyama, Cryptochron C2r.2r-1 and the onset of the Reunion Subchron, since the base of the section is 2.60+/-0.13 million years old, the middle part is 2.49+/-0.07 million years old and about 10 m below the top of the section the age is ~2.19+/-0.12 million years old. The objectives of this 2 year research study are related to the knowledge of field variations during periods like reversals and excursions and related to the critical time intervals that precede and follow reversals that so far have only been documented from a few sedimentary sequences, for the interval between 2.6 to ~2.012 Ma. Reversal studies cannot be separated from the surrounding polarity intervals and most records published so far were not long enough to provide complete information. The sequence offers the exceptional opportunity to study changes over a time period that includes several polarity intervals and thus documents the paleofield behavior over various time constants. This is a basic condition to extract and bring up significant constraints for the theoretical and numerical modeling of the generation of the paleofield. This research will have impacts on field like magnetostatigraphy, rock magnetism, geomagnetism and physical volcanism.  Several undergraduate students will be supported and involved in all aspects of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is focused on full vector studies in order to determine the total field vector and Paleosecular Variation (PSV) of the "stable" polarities. The study will focus on the successive periods of polarity and their associated reversals. The paleointensity experiments will be conducted using a version of the Thellier-Coe as well as the differential pTRM "multi-specimen" methods. The PIs have imposed severe criteria to discard samples affected by magneto-mineralogical transformations and with magnetization components involving multi-domain grains. It is important to deal with paleointensity values that rely on a minimum number of 5 to 8 determinations per flow in order to perform suitable statistical treatment. Given the time consuming aspect of paleointensity studies, a two-year period is envisaged to achieve the goals of this proposal including 10 more radiometric 40Ar/39Ar age determinations. The principal investigator and four undergraduate students will carry out the entire research project. The involvement of undergraduate students will be a priority in this project, from fieldwork, laboratory work, analysis and publication of the results.  Data will be disseminated through publication and on the web and community maintained paleomagnetic and geochronologic databases. This project will provide the stimulus to maintain the paleomagnetics operation at UH and the Rare Gas Lab. at the Univ. of Wisconsin at Madison both of which are used by a diverse group of students and researchers from all over the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The scientific project of this study is to study a very long pile of lavas that have been erupted by one of the volcanoes that make up the island of Oahu, Hawai The main goal of the study has been to determine the geomagnetic vectorial elements such as the declination, inclination and absolute paleointensity, i.e. the full vector  of lava flows from the base of the sequence located at sea level up to a verttcal distance of about 50 meters. The second most important goal was to determine by means of 40Ar/39Ar radiometric dating the age of about 10 flows strategically located from the base to the top of the piles of lavas.   The results of the paleomagnetic and rock magnetic tests coupled with radiometric determinations of the pile of lavas under question have yielded two kinds of  outcomes as follows:  1)   The lowermost ten lava flows of the Makapuu long volcanic sequence belong to the Honolulu Volcanic series that were erupted after the collapse of the Koolau tall volcanic edifice as was determined by the radiometric determinations of three specimens yielding a Plateau  age of  29.8+/-5.8 ka. See Figure 1. The magnetic elements such as declination, inclination and absolute paleointensity determinations are shown in figure 2. The calculation of the virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) has been done by converting the declination and inclination values  and such results are in  presented in figure 3 where the excursional or the so called ?aborted reversal? display a motion from high latitude polar regions to subsequently lingering to low latitudes  (~21o) and back to the north pole. The oldest flow is VGP #1 and the youngest  is VGP#10 of figure 3.  2) The flows above the Kaupo lavas belong to the Koolau Volcanic series at the Makapuu long volcanic sequence and the radiometric results of several (i.e. 10 radiometric determinations)  key flows indicate  ages ranging from  as old as 2.608+/-0.07 Ma corresponding to the Gauss-Matuyama reversal boundary and the onset (i.e. oldest Reunion Subchron) and as young to 2.19+/-0.10 Ma. See Figure 4. The summary of the magnetic volcanic "stratigraphy"  results indicate that the Makapuu point sequence recorded the Gauss/Matuyama polarity transition, Cryptochron C2r.2r-1 known also as the Halawa  episode (ca. 2.42+/-0.04Ma) see figure 5.  The integrated VGP diagram showing the motion of the Kaupo and Makapuu point long volcanic sequence  is shown in figure 6.
