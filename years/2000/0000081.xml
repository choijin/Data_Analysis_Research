    <AbstractNarration>Laser forming (LF) is a process in which sheet metal forming is achieved through controlled temperature gradients and thermal stresses produced by the rapid absorption of power from a scanning laser beam. LF requires no hard tooling and has the flexibility for low-volume fabrication and rapid prototyping of sheet metal components. LF can also be used to fine adjust sheet metal parts for, say, pre-welding fit-up. The goal of this project is to advance the state of knowledge in LF technology, and to develop capabilities for LF to produce sheet metal components with controlled dimension, mechanical properties, and microstructures, and to markedly improve accuracy, scalability and reliability of the LF process. The project will develop a numerical model for LF having much improved prediction capabilities and accuracy by coupling microstructural transformations analysis with thermal and mechanical analysis and by incorporating accurate material data at high temperatures and high strain rates; and carry out an aggressive experimental program for model validation through detailed in-process and post-process characterizations. Other thermal-mechanical manufacturing methods will be able to leverage upon the improved understanding and prediction capabilities of the coupled thermal-mechanical- microstructural model to be developed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of the project will open-up new opportunities for manufacturing of high-performance but conventionally hard-to-form materials, leading to innovative applications, thus opening new design options.</AbstractNarration>
