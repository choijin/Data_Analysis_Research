<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to renovate laboratory space in Wynn Hall at Colgate University. Wynn Hall has previously been used for teaching and research. The proposed renovation will create two private biochemical research laboratories and a shared biochemistry/molecular biology facility to be used for research and research training. In addition, a shared computer modeling and simulation facility and a new laser laboratory are being proposed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five faculty members, one postdoc, and numerous undergraduate students will conduct research in the proposed facility on a variety of biochemical topics, including structural and functional studies of catalysis and allostery in carbonic anhydrase; chemical modification of photosynthetic proteins; C-linked glycopeptide synthesis and conformer evaluation; gas phase conformation of six-membered rings; and spectroscopy, structure, and dynamics of model tropospheric aerosol particle surfaces. The PIs have a strong publication record including undergraduate students in the author lists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enhance infrastructure for research and in particular collaborative projects between students and faculty. The newly revised curriculum led to an increased number of majors, and the remodeled facilities will serve as a motivator to attract students to chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Colgate University Department of Chemistry is housed in Wynn Hall, constructed in 1978 prior to the development of an institutional emphasis on faculty-undergraduate student collaborative research. With the growth in our research emphasis, faculty had increasingly co-opted little-used teaching, office, and other support spaces in the building placing a strain on the buildingÆs HVAC and electrical systems leading to safety and environmental issues.              The NSF-supported renovation of five research laboratories has greatly improved the environment for collaborative work between faculty, post-doctoral students, and our undergraduates.  The renovation projects to Wynn Hall produced two private biochemical research laboratories (450 and 612 sf) and a shared biochemistry/molecular biology core facility (740 sf) that is used for research and research training in a new laboratory course designed to bridge teaching laboratories with research experiences.  The renovations also provided a larger, shared computer modeling and simulation facility (250 sf) with adequate cooling computing space and a new laser laboratory (625 sf) from unfinished space and storage areas in Wynn Hall that will accommodate two separate experimental stations.  It should be noted the costs incurred for the renovation of the computer modeling and simulation facility was covered by Colgate University as this area was not deemed a required research area by NSF.              With all renovations completed by September 2011, this proposalÆs four Co-PIs, the PI, their post-doctoral associates (3 over the course of the grant) and their research students (18 academic year undergraduates since the renovation and 17 currently; plus an additional 18 students over the past two summers) have made significant progress on their research projects.  The intellectual merit of these projects includes: 1. the structural and functional study of catalysis and allostery in b-carbonic anhydrase; 2. the chemical modification of photosynthetic proteins; 3. the synthesis and conformational evaluation of C-linked glycopeptides; 4. the gas-phase conformation of six-membered rings; and 5. the spectroscopy, structure, and dynamics of model tropospheric aerosol particle surfaces.              The broader impacts reside in the involvement of undergraduate students in all aspects of the proposed research.  Faculty-student collaborative research is a cherished tradition at Colgate University, and it is an important mechanism by which our students are prepared for graduate study and for employment in chemistry.  Due to curricular changes and the impact of this renovation, the department has seen a sustained increase in the number of majors moving from a three-year running average of 15 majors per year prior to renovation to 20 majors per year since the renovation (class years 2012, 2013, and 2014).  These research efforts have resulted in six journal publications and one book chapter since the move into our renovated spaces, seven research presentations at national meetings or as invited departmental seminars, plus eleven other presentations on undergraduate research at predominantly undergraduate institutions.
