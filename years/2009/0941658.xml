<AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops an enhancement to the traditional computing curriculum that combines traditional introductory courses and an opportunity to work with exciting new technology. In this approach, the introductory programming sequence is not disturbed, but courses are introduced that reinforce fundamental concepts using mobile game development. Mobile game development provides a new and exciting avenue to recruit and retain the new generation of computer scientists. The companion courses are designed to reinforce core computer science concepts introduced in beginning computing courses using mobile game development with iPod Touch technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of the growing trend of teaching CS1/CS2 type classes using game development as a class context. The main effort of the project lies in developing a broad set of eight games-based modules that can be used at several points in the undergraduate CS curriculum.  It is expected that this project has a positive impact on women in computing and its use in beginning courses could help to attract and retain women in computing studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of institutions have indicated an interest in using the materials due to a good dissemination plan.  That plan includes a set of presentations and conference workshops/tutorials, online forums and discussion groups, and project Web site to be contributed to NSDL/CITIDEL as well as several other repositories.</AbstractNarration>
