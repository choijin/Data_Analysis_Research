<AbstractNarration>Because today's students often have a fragmented and incomplete understanding of the microscopic world, they do not have a knowledge base from which to make informed decisions on issues like nuclear power or the safe storage of nuclear waste.  This project, a collaboration between physics and chemistry educators, is developing inquiry-based instructional materials to help students who are not majoring in science build more robust and coherent mental models of atomic-scale phenomena.  The course is intended to help students understand phenomena like the origin of radioactive particles, the difference between ionizing and electromagnetic radiation, and the basic mechanism of tissue damage when exposed to radiation. The project incorporates both computer simulations and effective, inexpensive experiments into its instructional approach.  As part of the project, a "concepts assessment" for these types of phenomena is being developed and tested.</AbstractNarration>

Medical procedures that use radiation are  increasingly common, radioactive materials are used in industry, and despite everyoneÆs best efforts there still are the rare nuclear accidents and incidents. When people hear news of a radiological incident, their fears or bravado are both fueled by limited knowledge about radiation. The goal of this project is to make it possible for the majority of Americans to become radiation literate so that we can make informed choices on the technology as a society.  But in order for this to happen, teachers have to know how to teach about radiation so that students can understand it, and at this point few teachers do.  What was missing was in-depth knowledge about the learning process &ndash; how students tend to think about radiation, and what experiences they need to change their thinking. Also, teachers need tools and knowledge to make this happen in a real classroom.  The Inquiry into Radioactivity (IiR) project developed what is likely the first complete and research-based set of classroom materials, teacherÆs guides, and simulators necessary for American non-science college and high school students to understand ionizing radiation.  Also, complementary to the materials development process, the project conducted extensive in-class research on student learning to identify difficulties students had with the topic. These findings drove substantial changes in the materials to address unexpected difficulties such as the following:  Students didnÆt initially realize that there are many different kinds of radiation &ndash; cell phones do not emit ionizing radiation.

Other interesting things have to be learned first.  A person who is radiation literate knows what radiation is, where it comes from, and how it can be useful or can do harm. Unfortunately, the greatest learning difficulty that we found is with what radiation is! Most people initially think of radiation as something like a substance or an infection. They think of it as a "dangerous substance" that is emitted from radioactive objects &ndash; it gets on other objects and makes them radioactive in turn.  This is not the correct view.  Moreover, data collected in the classroom showed that it is difficult for students to change their thinking about this.

For example, research in the IiR classroom showed that nearly all of the incoming non-science college students were thinking of radiation as substance-like.
