<AbstractNarration>"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #: 09-59958&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Bhattacharya, Sambit; Almeida, Michael; Czejdo, Bogdan, D.; Montoya, Daniel&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Fayetteville State University &lt;br/&gt;Title:  MRI-R2: Acq. of Robots and Robot Accessories for Interdisciplinary Faculty and Student Research&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring four research grade robot platforms along with accessories required for navigation, robot vision, and robot-human interaction within a hybrid architecture, enables research in mobile reactive and hybrid robots. It also forms the basis of a robotics laboratory for conducting such research.&lt;br/&gt;The work addresses research in the following areas: spatial and temporal representation and reasoning using cognitive maps, stereo vision and object recognition, rapid modification and testing for correctness of reactive behaviors, and human experience of embodiment using robots.  Although the institution currently utilizes educational robots in teaching activities, a robot platform suitable for human-robot interaction research is needed.  Currently, no advanced robotics research facility exists at FSU or other local universities.&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of this equipment for a Robotics Lab strengthens interdisciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Psychology and Mathematics and Computer Science. Students in Psychology benefit from learning about computer hardware components and programming algorithms, while students in Computer Science learn about and work with concepts of cognitive psychology. A room within the science building at FSU is currently being refurbished to conduct the research projects described in this proposal, and store the robots.  The PI and a co-PIs are responsible for installation of the robots at FSU.  Most accessory and software installation in the robot bases will mainly be done by the vendor before shipping, so very little time and effort will be required to get started using the robots.  Since one robot base will be used per project described in the proposal, there is no initial allocation needed.  A long term maintenance contract from the vendor is included as part of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The equipment enables research activities involving undergraduate and graduate students, contributing to train them in advanced scientific research methodology and application development.  This training benefits students from segments of population who are traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines since FSU is a minority serving institution. The existing facilities at FSU are adequate for introductory programming and behavior based robotics courses.  This new equipment and the space committed by the university to support the project enables advanced research and training.  The activities supported by the equipment strengthen research at FSU.  The new equipment will be available to regional faculty who are interested in conducting research in robotics and related fields.</AbstractNarration>
