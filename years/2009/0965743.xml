<AbstractNarration>This project is providing need-based scholarships over four years to 18 graduate students (5-10 MS students and 4-8 PhD students) in the Civil and Environmental Engineering programs at the University of South Florida. The project is designed around the theme of sustainable water and transportation infrastructure.  The project team includes teaching faculty members, each of whom has an active research program. A full-circle mentoring plan is being implemented between faculty and doctoral students, as well as between PhD students and MS students. Efforts are being made to recruit and retain a diverse cohort of graduate students (with and without first degrees in engineering) into advanced engineering programs and to prepare students to be globally competitive by promoting knowledge transfer between students and faculty that have different global perspectives while integrating the most appropriate knowledge, methodologies, techniques, and practices from both the developed and developing worlds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Physical infrastructures, such as water supply and treatment, wastewater treatment/resource recovery, and transportation systems are critical to the welfare of humans and the NationÆs economy.  The system interconnection of water and energy in a global context (termed as the water-energy-global nexus in this proposal), specifically for water and transportation infrastructures, was the theme of this proposal. The goal of this S-STEM project (that provided MS and PhD engineering scholarships to financially-needy students) was to advance more sustainable planning, design, and management of water and transportation infrastructure through education and unique knowledge transfer across the boundaries of the developing and developed world. Eighty-two financially needy graduate engineering students enrolled in civil or environmental engineering were awarded scholarships during the 5 years of the project and only 1 student has left the graduate program.  The program supported 63 MS and 19 PhD students.  This included 44 men (54%), 38 women (46%), and 18 under-represented minorities (22%) (Objective 1 included recruiting and retaining a diverse group of ~72 financially needy graduate civil or environmental engineering students).   Nineteen students did not hold a first degree in engineering (another project emphasis) and six MS students continued their education by enrolling in PhD programs.  Students who have graduated from the program have obtained engineering employment in the areas of water and transportation with private industry, government, and non-governmental organizations. The program helped to improve the global competency of the U.S. engineering workforce by providing students an opportunity to increase their understanding of how to work effectively with engineers and other co-workers from countries other than the studentÆs own country, especially those who may solve and define problems differently than the student.  Fifty seven (70%) of the S STEM participants were provided some type of international research experience, with 43 of these participating in a Peace Corps MasterÆs International graduate partnership (Objectives 3 and 4 were related to creating non-traditional flow of knowledge between developed and developing world engineering solutions through integrated PhD and MS experiences).  The Peace Corps graduate partnership allowed students to combine graduate education and service as an engineer with 2+ years of international training and work experience.  The twelve countries where these students were located are: Cambodia, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Liberia, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Namibia, Uganda, and Zambia.  We also integrated students with international opportunities through an existing NSF REU program in Globalization and Community Health Field School in Monteverde Costa Rica and placing them in Europe to study more resilient coastal water-energy management. Several other students performed research on low energy methods to manage water and wastewater in Bolivia through an NSF IRES project. Objective 5 was to create peer mentoring through required teaming during courses and research as well as mentoring workshops.  All students accepted the volunteer opportunity to conduct research as part of their graduate degree program.  STEM scholars took a transportation or environmental graduate seminar course which provided them opportunities to use their skills in engineering practice by learning about engineering projects in the project theme area.  Students were also provided opportunities to interact with engineering and science practitioners through participation in local and national professional meetings.   Surveys showed that 92% of participants expect to work in engineering practice or further their graduate education after completing the program and one student indicated they wished to start a business.  Students were also required to take one of two sustainability focused courses (many stud...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
