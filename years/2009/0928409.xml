<AbstractNarration>The objective of the US GEOTRACES program, a newly initiated international oceanographic program, is to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the oceans and to establish an understanding of the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions.  Neodymium (Nd), a rare earth element, is supplied to the ocean via continental weathering, and its isotopes have been identified as an important ocean tracer that could potentially improve our understanding of water mass pathways, as well as identify sources and sinks of trace elements in modern and past oceans.  Scientists from Columbia University, the University of South Carolina, and the University of Hawaii will be conducting a rigorous survey of the distribution of dissolved seawater Nd isotopes and concentrations along the 2010 GEOTRACES North Atlantic zonal section.  Results from this study will determine how well Nd isotopes track advected water masses in marginal and open ocean settings, estimate the Nd contribution from submarine groundwater discharge, and determine atmospheric Nd input and fluxes into and out of marine sediments. This research will aid scientists in determining the oceanic distribution of Nd isotopes on a global scale. The educational impacts of this research include support for a graduate and postdoctoral student, as well as training opportunities for an undergraduate student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ GEOTRACES is an international study that will revolutionize our knowledge of the oceans. Its guiding mission is "to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions" (GEOTRACES Science Plan). In a warming world, the science plan notes that "understanding the processes that control the transport and fate of these contaminants is an important aspect of protecting the ocean environment. Such understanding requires accurate knowledge of the natural biogeochemical cycling of these elements so that changes due to human activity can be put into context &hellip;  and their impact on the carbon cycle and climate understood." Its model is the early 1970Æs GEOSECS Program, which systematically obtained geochemical data from the global oceans, and which has formed a basis of our knowledge of the oceans. Since then, there have been tremendous technical developments and new approaches to studying the oceans. GEOTRACES is a 21st century response to these developments.  This project is part of the North Atlantic Zonal Transect cruise, whose cruise track is Lisbon-Mauritania-Bermuda-Woods Hole, and is a collaboration of scientists from three universities (Columbia, U Hawaii, U South Carolina). Our project was to measure the isotope ratios and concentrations of neodymium (Nd), which is part of the suite of key ætrace elements and isotopes, or æTEIsÆ in the GEOTRACES Program. This obscure sounding TEI is part of the plan because it acts as a ædyeÆ on water masses and can be used to trace where they come from and where they go. Moreover, it can be used in conjunction with other æTEIsÆ to help to understand what is happening to them. Nd is supplied to the oceans mainly from the continents, in solution and on particles (suspended sediment and wind-born dust). The æNd isotope ratioÆ (which acts as the ædyeÆ) in particles or in water masses reflects the age of the continents that they come from. Because these ages are different in different places (e.g. very old continent around the North Atlantic, younger around the Pacific), the Nd isotope ratios vary between different water masses. As a ædyeÆ, it will keep its æcolorÆ until new Nd is added. If water masses of two æcolorsÆ mix, the new æcolorÆ reflects the mixture. If new Nd is supplied at a specific location, it will affect its æcolorÆ.  Nd is one of the TEIs whose use had not been developed yet during the GEOSECS program, and as a result there is a dearth of seawater Nd isotope data and hence major gaps in our knowledge of its sources, sinks, and cycling in the ocean. In fact, in this project, our new measurements are equivalent to more than 20% of the published measurements at the time of this report. Here are some of our primary results thus far.

Here, the ædyeÆ aspect of Nd isotopes provides new information compared to other TEIs, and indicates that there are different biologically active and inactive components of Nd in the same water parcel; this must also be a basic aspect of other TEIs.
