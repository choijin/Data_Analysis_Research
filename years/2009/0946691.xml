<AbstractNarration>This conference project will convene science museum leaders and technical experts in the giant-screen theater field to start a process of establishing shared Digital Immersive Giant Screen Specifications.  The institutional giant screen theaters are facing significant challenges in converting from traditional analog large screen film to new digital systems.  The analog film inventory investment is at risk, as are the science museum theaters as new digital formats become dominant.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Prior to the conference, a pre-session Online Forum will provide research reports, proposed technical solutions, and opportunities for discussion.  A Colloquium will bring together industry professionals for two days to develop an initial consensus on standards and outline trial tests for next steps.  A post-session Online Forum will make possible wider review and recommendations on the specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborators include the Giant Screen Cinema Association, International Planetarium Society, Assocation of Science-Technology Centers, and MacGillivray Freeman Films Educational Foundation, which will assist with the dissemination of the draft specifications. LF Examiner will provide data on theaters and films, and the Institute for Learning Innovation will conduct the  summative evaluation, which will build on  other  research (e.g., DRL-0610253, Maya Skies) related to the impact of large screen immersive films on learners.</AbstractNarration>
