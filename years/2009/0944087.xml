<AbstractNarration>This award supports a project to understand the flow dynamics of large, fast-moving outlet glaciers that drain the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. The project includes an integrated field, remote sensing and modeling study of Byrd Glacier which is a major pathway for the discharge of mass from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) to the ocean. Recent work has shown that the glacier can undergo short-lived but significant changes in flow speed in response to perturbations in its boundary conditions. Because outlet glacier speeds exert a major control on ice sheet mass balance and modulate the ice sheet contribution to sea level rise, it is essential that their sensitivity to a range of dynamic processes is properly understood and incorporated into prognostic ice sheet models. The intellectual merit of the project is that the results from this study will provide critically important information regarding the flow dynamics of large EAIS outlet glaciers. The proposed study is designed to address variations in glacier behavior on timescales of minutes to years. A dense network of global positioning satellite (GPS) instruments on the grounded trunk and floating portions of the glacier will provide continuous, high-resolution time series of horizontal and vertical motions over a 26-month period. These results will be placed in the context of a longer record of remote sensing observations covering a larger spatial extent, and the combined datasets will be used to constrain a numerical model of the glacier's flow dynamics. The broader impacts of the work are that this project will generate results which are likely to be a significant component of next-generation ice sheet models seeking to predict the evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and future rates of sea level rise. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the imperfect understanding of outlet glacier dynamics as a major obstacle to the production of an accurate sea level rise projections. This project will provide significant research opportunities for several early-career scientists, including the lead PI for this proposal (she is both a new investigator and a junior faculty member at a large research university) and two PhD-level graduate students. The students will be trained in glaciology, geodesy and numerical modeling, contributing to society's need for experts in those fields. In addition, this project will strengthen international collaboration between polar scientists and geodesists in the US and Spain. The research team will work closely with science educators in the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) outreach program to disseminate project results to non-specialist audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><!-- P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link {  } --> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Antarctica Ice Sheet is drained by numerous large outlet glaciers which move mass from the interior of the ice sheet towards the coast. Like conveyor belts, the faster (or slower) they move, the more (or less) mass they transport towards the margin. Therefore, future changes in the size and shape of the ice sheet, and hence global sea levels, are largely controlled by the speed of outlet glaciers. Much progress has been made in mapping the flow speeds of Antarctica&rsquo;s largest outlet glaciers using observations collected by Earth orbiting satellites, but many of these maps have coarse resolution and represent average behavior over a period of years. Recent work has showed that outlet glaciers are able to undergo significant (10-50%) changes in speed over relatively short time-scales (weeks to months). The purpose of this project was to investigate variations in the speed of Byrd Glacier, the second-largest glacier in Antarctica. Byrd Glacier drains approximately one million sq. kilometers of the ice sheet through a deep trough (approximately 150 km long and 25 km wide) in the Transantarctic Mountains to the Ross Ice Shelf, at which point the glacier goes afloat in ocean water. Flow speeds through the trough average almost 800 meters per year but in an analysis of satellite datasets from 2006-2007 we detected a year-long speed-up of the glacier, amounting to about 10%, which coincided with an outburst flood of two subglacial lakes upstream of the trough. In this project, we deployed an extensive network of continuously-recording global positioning system (GPS) receivers at 30 sites along the trough of Byrd Glacier and overlying the locations of the upstream lakes. An analysis of the data reveals numerous variations in Byrd Glacier&rsquo;s flow speed, most of which are related to the action of ocean tides on the lower reaches of the glacier. We also detected an infilling and draining of the two upstream lakes over a 2-3 year period which is much faster than previously assumed. Altogether our observations point to a dynamic set of conditions controlling the flow speed of Antarctica&rsquo;s outlet glaciers.
