<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to compile and provide information (e.g., species name, location, habitat, and flowering time) from California-collected vascular plant specimens held at 19 herbaria in California and at Harvard University (repository of many older California specimens). The plants targeted are those that dominate California habitats and those most imperiled by threats to biodiversity (including climate change). Specimen information will be available online at the Consortium of California Herbaria (CCH) Web portal (http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium). The project will also accomplish the seamless provision of data on California plants held by the museums of SEINet (Southwest Environmental Information Network) via the CCH web site as a step toward building regional and national consortia.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project provides tangible benefits to the public, students of all levels, and the research community. Specimen data will be downloadable so that anyone can use the information to pursue interests and questions (e.g., understanding current plant distributions, identifying plants of a particular place, predicting future plant migrations). Undergraduate students will be involved extensively with data entry, providing them with skills and training applicable to future professional pursuits. This project is a major step toward building a United States virtual plant museum that provides information on the distribution of plants nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Harnessing the Power of Herbaria to Understand the Changing Flora of California:  A Biodiversity Hotspot in Peril.  California has over 5,500 native plant taxa;   over 40% of them are endemic &ndash; meaning that they are found nowhere else in the world.  In addition, many of those species (at least 1/3) are threatened or endangered.  The threats to CaliforniaÆs native flora come from many sources such as population growth, changes in land use patterns, invasive species and climate change.  In order for researchers and land managers to understand how changes will affect the native plants and how to best track the impact of those changes, it is necessary to have baseline data about where and how abundant these species were in the past and where things stand now.  There is a rich botanical history in California dating back to the founding of the first scientific institutions in the state during the mid-1850Æs.  Beginning in 1853, with the founding of the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) in San Francisco, followed a few short years later by the founding of the University of California at Berkeley, professional and amateur botanists began collecting, pressing and preserving samples of the native flora.  Those collections are protected and stored in a herbarium, along with data about when and where the plants were collected.  These collections are available for students and researchers to consult.  Until recently it has been very difficult for scientists to access data from the collections without physically going to a herbarium and collecting the label data themselves, or by borrowing specimens from the institution that houses them.  Often the specimens necessary to complete a scientistÆs research were located in herbaria scattered around the world, making travel expensive and time consuming. Shipping these often fragile specimens puts them at risk of damage or loss and has also become increasingly expensive.  With the advent of powerful relational databases, the ability to quickly make high resolution images of specimens, and new georeferencing and mapping tools, the information contained on herbarium specimens can now be made available and searchable through easily accessible web portals.  With over 3,400 herbaria in the world and an estimated 350 million herbarium specimens, these records provide an important tool and a crucial resource for conservation and biodiversity research.   In California alone there are over 75 herbaria managed by universities, museums, botanical gardens, non-profit organizations and state and federal agencies.  Nearly 30 of those herbaria have come together to form the California Consortium of Herbaria (CCH), which was intended to serve as a gateway to information about California plants.  The primary goal of this NSF-funded project was to digitize hundreds of thousands of new specimen records, georeference over 500,000 localities and to make all of that information available through one searchable web portal.  The entire project involves California institutions, one neighboring regional consortium that houses additional California data, and one east coast institution which houses thousands of historical records from the earliest explorations of California.  The California Academy of Sciences houses the largest number of these specimens records that had not yet been digitized.  Our specific role in this project was to capture the data from 153,900 specimens.  The species that were chosen to be digitized are plants that form a dominant part of the California landscape (i.e. woody plants and grasses) and plants that are most imperiled by threats to biodiversity, including threatened/endangered species and alpine plants.  Climate change will exacerbate the perils faced by a diverse and threatened flora. Having accurate information in order to model how plants might respond to the pressures they face will enable researchers to more accurately predict how the flora will respond to changes and will all...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
