<AbstractNarration>The Association for Institutional Research (AIR) proposes a two-year continuation of a program that has increased the capacity of the postsecondary education community to utilize national sample surveys and other NSF and NCES data sets, thereby improving the quality of information underlying decision making in postsecondary education, and the quality of' those decisions. The proposed program has four components that will 1) support new research initiatives, 2) support dissemination of findings, 3) provide face-to-face training in the use of national databases, and 4) produce media-supported training in the use of national databases for dissemination via the Web. These components are targeted to doctoral students, postsecondary faculty, and institutional researchers who study higher education including trends in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and institutional researchers who use national data in comparative studies and decision support at colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit According to Education Pays 2010: The Benefits of Higher Education for Individuals and Society, published by the College Board, "students who attend institutions of higher education obtain a wide range of personal, financial, and other lifelong benefits; likewise, taxpayers and society as a whole derive a multitude of direct and indirect benefits when citizens have access to postsecondary education" (p. 4). Degree completion is also significant for international competiveness. Recent data published by the Organization for Economic Co-operative and Development (OECD) identify that while the United States has a greater than average attainment rate for tertiary education among 25-64 year olds (42 percent), the rate of growth is below-average when compared to other OECD countries (Education at a Glance: OECD Indicators 2012). If this does not improve, other countries will likely pass the United States in tertiary attainment. Therefore, research on higher education, including studies of postsecondary access and pathways to completion, serve not just the individual, but the greater good as well, increasing the benefits to the larger society and AmericaÆs reputation in the global marketplace.  AIR research and dissertation grants supported research on timely topics, including state financial aid policies, student dropout risks, socioeconomic status and enrollment, online learning, student loan default, and STEM career paths. In addition, the National Postsecondary Education Cooperative (NPEC) supported research on the effect of socioeconomic factors on studentsÆ access to and success in postsecondary education, as well as measures of institutional effectiveness and student success beyond traditional graduation rate reporting. Grant-funded research that incorporated the use of NSF and NCES data and/or specific topics identified by NPEC, demonstrated the utility of federal datasets in addressing national policy issues in STEM and higher education. By encouraging studies that incorporated the multiple perspectives of NSF, NCES, and NPEC, this grant also showed the significance of collaboration among federal agencies, enabling researchers to conduct studies that would be more useful to a wider range of audiences.  AIR also facilitated an annual week-long conference, the National Data Institute: Using Federal Data to Support Research on Science, Engineering, and Postsecondary Education that provided higher education professionals an intensive introduction to NSF and NCES datasets and research methodologies for using large national data sources. Participants were selected based on their current research interest in using national datasets and how their work will advance higher education research or inform campus-level decision-making.  Broader Implications Research supported by this NSF grant contributed to higher education and STEM policies at the federal, state, and institution levels. AIR facilitated the dissemination of research results in three ways. First, all grant recipients presented at AIRÆs annual conference...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
