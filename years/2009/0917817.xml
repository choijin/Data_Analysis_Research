<AbstractNarration>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution proposes to support technical services on three research vessels, all operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  Ships to be supported include R/V Atlantis, R/V Knorr, and R/V Oceanus.  As part of their basic operations they will provide one (Oceanus) or two (Atlantis, Knorr) technicians on each seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation, including use of the multibeam echosounders on Atlantis and Knorr. They also propose to provide several elements of specialized support for investigators, with separate charges. Specialized support requested for 2009 includes 1) Technical support aboard the USCGC Healy, 2) Long Core Operations aboard R/V Knorr, and 3) Support for the Sea Education Association (SEA).  The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
