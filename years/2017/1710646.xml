<AbstractNarration>Non-technical summary&lt;br/&gt;A major part of our body consists of proteins that form fiber networks. These networks fulfill a multitude of essential functions, such as providing elasticity to our skin and preventing it from overstretching. Understanding how these macroscopic properties arise from the networks' individual components is thus crucial to our understanding of basic physiological processes, our ability to treat diseases, and the future design of novel materials that mimic biological tissue. Such an understanding remains elusive, however, due to a lack of experimental techniques that can resolve fibrous networks with single filament resolution, while also quantifying their contribution to the large-scale network. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to establish a microscopy technique that can resolve the contribution of each filament to the overall large-scale properties of the network. It will be applied to collagen networks with and without cells, and to tissue samples from bioprosthetic heart valves.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is expected to provide material researchers with a better understanding of micromechanical processes in fibrous biopolymer networks. This work could result in the development of novel materials for guiding cell growth, artificial skin and organs, and new methods for drug delivery that rely on the behavior of biological tissue under mechanical stress. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in an interdisciplinary environment on a unique state-of-the-art instrument, and female high-school students will participate in research as part of an outreach program. These high-school students will furthermore benefit from direct contact with other researchers at the university through lab visits and research presentations.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical summary&lt;br/&gt;The development and application of the novel optical microscopy technique is expected to result in the visualization and quantification of the transition from individual fiber to bulk properties in biopolymer networks. Assumptions made in theories about the micromechanical behavior of this important class of materials will be tested. &lt;br/&gt;Because the method is diffraction limited, networks with mesh sizes larger than the dimensions of the focal spot will be chosen. Networks will be imaged and the stress distribution along filaments will be quantified and visualized. The fiber-precise resolution will be used to study the force generation of cells in collagen gels. Fibrous tissue samples of bioprosthetic heart valves will be tested for signs of degeneration. &lt;br/&gt;The more detailed understanding of the micromechanical behavior displayed by biopolymer networks opens a new opportunity to control cell growth and tissue formation by rationally designed biocompatible and biodegradable materials. &lt;br/&gt;The novel microscopy technique will enable the study of force generation of cells in fibrous networks with single filament resolution, as well as the observation of their force-mediated communication. New insight into mechanical signaling between cells in the extracellular matrix is expected, as well as into the degeneration of bioprosthetic heart valve tissue. &lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in an interdisciplinary environment on state-of-the-art instrumentation in a field that directly benefits national health and prosperity.</AbstractNarration>
