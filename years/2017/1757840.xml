<AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Delaware's College of Earth, Ocean and Environment in Lewes, DE will be renewed for three years. The program will bring ten undergraduates to the Lewes campus each summer, and interns will conduct semi-independent research projects during the 10-week program. At the end of the summer, interns present their results during a mini-symposium and write up their work as a scientific paper. Weekly seminars by University of Delaware faculty will provide interns with a broad overview of marine sciences. Professional development workshops include career paths in the sciences, science communication, and graduate school funding. Interns will participate in several field trips including a day trip aboard the R/V Joanne Daiber, which introduces them to a variety of research and oceanographic techniques, a field trip to Cape Henlopen State Park, for hands-on introduction to coastal geology, and a marsh walk, which introduces them to the inhabitants and the ecological role of these systems. Students will be encourage to continue their research after the program, either by being a co-author on a scientific publication, pursuing a senior thesis or attending a scientific conference. The program also includes a partnership with the Delaware Technical Community College. Most of the funding provided supports participant costs for thirty undergraduates, including student stipends, housing and transportation to and from their home to participate in the program. This REU program contributes to the national goals of training the next generation of scientists and developing the nation's scientifically-trained workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Delaware will continue to manage the REU program located on their Lewes, DE campus, which will provide students with direct access to faculty research mentors, the extensive research facilities on campus and the coastal environment. The College of Earth, Ocean and Environmental Sciences includes the Departments of Geological Sciences and Geography and the School of Marine Science and Policy, offering students the opportunity for interdisciplinary research topics. Faculty mentors' expertise spans the range of marine science and professional development activities will introduce students to skills required for successful careers. The program will support the extensive technical training for thirty undergraduates, preparing these students to enter the workforce or to pursue additional graduate training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
