<AbstractNarration>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star passes close to a massive black hole (MBH) and is torn apart by tidal forces.  These events produce luminous, short-lived flares, which can be observed from Earth.  Most "normal" TDEs occur when the star passes within the tidal radius of the MBH, leading to a one-time shredding of the star.  However, it is possible that stars are captured into highly eccentric orbits with closest approach distance larger than the tidal radius.  These stars will not be immediately disrupted but will undergo multiple tidal encounters with the MBH.  A research team at Cornell University will study the physics of such encounters, including the oscillations and waves set up in the star, and then use powerful computer models to determine how the evolution of the star and its orbit around the MBH are affected and whether the star will ultimately be torn apart.  The research team will include both graduate and undergraduate students and will produce visualizations and animations of the results for use in educational and outreach programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will study a new regime for TDEs, involving multiple pericenter passages of a star with a MBH, leading to a qualitatively different evolutionary path toward tidal disruption and a potentially distinct observational signature.  The projects that will be undertaken range from well-defined to exploratory and the work has the potential to lead to new discoveries.  The research will enhance the understanding of the interaction between stars and MBHs at the centers of galaxies and will help interpret ongoing and future observations of luminous transient sources.</AbstractNarration>
