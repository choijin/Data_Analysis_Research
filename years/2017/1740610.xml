<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative proposal to build an online, open-access, searchable, central repository for atmospheric chamber data in the United States called ICARUS (Index of Chamber Atmospheric Research in the United States).  Fundamental data obtained from chamber studies are routinely used as empirical inputs and constraints in atmospheric models. There are nine major U.S. research institutions participating in this project, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  This sustainable web-based infrastructure for storing, sharing, and using atmospheric chamber data will synergistically facilitate atmospheric chemistry research in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the project are to (1) provide a searchable public index of the chamber experiments from each participating research group; (2) archive past chamber data from each participating group under their indexed chamber experiment; (3) standardize chamber data reporting formats; (4) provide a uniform template for chamber metadata; and (5) streamline future data submissions.  The data products included in ICARUS are: (A) gas phase data that describes the time-resolved profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as gaseous hydrocarbons, oxidized VOCs, oxidants (OH, O3, NO3), NOx, SO2, and other data; (B) particle phase data that describes yields of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) as well as optical properties, composition (detailed molecular and bulk elemental ratios), and chemical functional groups; (C) supporting information such as relative humidity, temperature, and light flux; (D) the experimental notes required to understand the data (such as reaction timing, mixing procedures, seed particle addition, and so on); and (E) vapor and particulate wall deposition rates that are needed to correct chamber data.  At the end of the 3-year project, the database will be transitioned to the Data Stewardship Engineering Team at NCAR.</AbstractNarration>
