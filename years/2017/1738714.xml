<AbstractNarration>Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or "drones" have captured our attention as a means to collect aerial sensor data, carry small payloads, and motivate students through low-cost, hands-on flight experiences. Numerous research challenges related to safely operating UAS of all sizes and missions must be addressed before we can realize their full potential. The Center for UAS (C-UAS) is an existing National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) supporting a wide range of UAS-centric research topics. C-UAS, led by Brigham-Young University, has successfully transitioned into Phase II. The C-UAS I/UCRC provides a critical pathway for university and industry members to collaboratively identify and explore important basic and applied research relevant to UAS. The University of Michigan proposes to join the C-UAS team, offering new industry members and new research expertise to the existing center. The Michigan team complements existing C-UAS strengths in autonomy, guidance, navigation, and control and offers new expertise in high altitude long endurance platforms, reduced-order aerodynamics modeling, and energy harvesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C-UAS is pursuing two new center-wide focus areas to kick off Phase II: autonomy and counter-UAS. For autonomy, Michigan researchers will pursue identification and infusion of new data sources to enable future UAS flight planners to quantitatively model and minimize risk to people and property on the ground. Michigan will also extend previous work in static and dynamic geofencing to assure each UAS remains within airspace it is authorized to occupy. For counter-UAS, Michigan will pursue fundamental research to analyze and design defense strategies against aerial swarms through development of information-sharing and motion models that can be used to compute jamming and interception defensive actions. The Michigan team will also investigate two new UAS research thrusts. High-altitude long-endurance (HALE) flight is envisioned through a flexible-wing platform that offers light-weight aerodynamically-efficient performance; the proposed research will develop a validated model of aeroelastic effects coupled with flight dynamics for very-flexible UAS with modeling, simulation, and UAS flight experiments. A second new research effort will develop reduced-order models of the atmospheric boundary layer and vehicle aeromechanics effects that account for day/night convection in complex terrain and urban corridors with application to UAS flight planning, trajectory prediction, and control.</AbstractNarration>
