<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the availability of a patient readiness formula, an algorithm that will improve outcomes by engaging patients in their own healthcare from hospital admission through discharge. The societal impact includes (1) reducing the cost related to readmissions for Congestive Heart Failure, Acute Myocardial Infarction, and pneumonia, a total of $5.8 billion annually paid by U.S. taxpayers, (2) decreasing the cost of each hospital stay by $5-10K per Medicare beneficiary by using proven treatment and discharge planning models, (3) reducing the burden on post-acute providers (primary care physician, long-term care, home health, ambulatory care) by achieving optimized clinical stability prior to discharge, and (4) providing a method for a patient population (studies show who are eager to participate) to actively engage in their own treatment decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will create a proprietary algorithm that produces a patient-specific hospital readmission-risk score. The score is based on the algorithm's dynamic adjustment of all known readmission risk factors determined by the patient's unique profile that includes clinical and other factors. The goal of the project is to accurately predict a patient's readmission-risk using the dynamic algorithm. The results of the algorithm will be verified via the facility's claims system. Technical challenges to be addressed by Phase I include the compilation of known risk factors, development of the algorithm, and creating multi-tract data input methods to obtain live data. The research and development plan will focus on identifying risks, development of the algorithm, and determining methods for capturing live data needed to execute the algorithm.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the NSF SBIR Phase I Award Number 1746535 was to determine the feasibility of producing an algorithm that will generate a score indicating a patient?s risk for hospital readmission. The potential societal impact of this research includes (1) reducing the costs related to readmissions for congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia (PNE), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), total hip replacement (THR), and total knee replacement (TKR), (2) decreasing the cost of each hospital stay by using proven treatment and discharge planning models, (3) reducing the burden on post-acute providers (primary care physician, long-term care, home health, ambulatory care) by achieving optimized clinical stability prior to discharge, and (4) providing a method for a patient population (studies show who are eager to participate) to actively engage in their own treatment decisions.   The algorithm maps identified readmission risk predictors in a rolling pattern using logistical regression, linear regression (or combination of both). The result is a unique algorithm specific to a patient?s dynamics at any particular point in time.   To satisfy the objective Home Care Business Services (HCBS) had to achieve three (3) outcomes:   1.    Determine what constitutes a readmission risk and the risk?s importance, relevance or ?weight? in the algorithm,  2.    Write the algorithm, 3.    Develop multi-tract methodology for data capture of real-time status of risk factors.   The list of risk factors that were selected for evaluation by the algorithm (Tasks 1 &amp; 2) were compiled via a thorough and exhaustive review of empirical and market studies, and customer discovery.   The methods for collecting and normalizing the risk factor data (Tasks 3 - 11) via electronic medical record data-extraction, patient/caregiver and clinical interfaces were successfully completed with a handful of minor and solvable problems.   Finally, the method to evaluate the algorithm?s accuracy (Tasks 12 - 15) was analyzed and established.   In summary, HCBS has proven that it is possible for an algorithm, populated with specific patient data that is fully verified to represent known risks, can measure and predict the potential for hospital readmission. In Phase I, HCBS developed such an algorithm and the methods to collect the data to supply the algorithm with data. Bench-level testing indicates that the software application that executes the algorithm is complete and ready to be deployed for testing.
