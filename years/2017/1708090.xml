<AbstractNarration>Natural disasters are stressful events with cognitive consequences that are poorly understood.  In August of 2016, historic flooding in the greater Baton Rouge, LA area resulted in 13 deaths and an estimated 8.7 billion in damages. While this flooding occurred in one region of the country, natural disasters take many forms and can occur in all parts of the United States and around the world. A clear understanding of the consequences of natural disasters on cognition, especially for older adults, has important scientific and societal impacts. The research supported by this award will examine functioning in multiple cognitive domains following a disaster to assess the consequences of stress on cognition and the impact on everyday functioning in a number of real-world situations. The study will measure these cognitive domains at two time points to allow for consideration of how individuals recover following such events. Tracking the relationships among cognitive domains across time has implications for basic understanding of the architecture of cognition as well as how it is influenced by disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Rapid Response Research Grant (RAPID), Dr. Katie Cherry (Louisiana State University) and her research team will explore several key elements of cognition that relate to functioning "in the moment."  They will obtain measures of immediate memory, or working memory, sustained attentional resources, long-term memory, and intelligence in a longitudinal design with data collection at two points following disaster exposure.  By examining working memory, and its relationship to other key constructs of cognitive functioning, the research team will gain valuable knowledge regarding the consequences of natural disasters on the moment-to-moment cognition that is critical when responding to a disaster. Prior research studies have noted the relationship between working memory and long-term memory as predictors of fluid intelligence, or the ability to detect patterns and solve new problems in the moment, with working memory accounting for unique variance in fluid intelligence.  In the current study, the longitudinal association of working memory, sustained attention, long-term memory, and fluid intelligence will provide further evidence of the critical role that working memory plays in fluid intelligence, and will significantly extend prior research by assessing the relationship between these objective measures of cognition and self-appraisals of functioning and sleep disruption in daily life.  Additionally, the research team will measure these variables in three groups of participants that vary in degree of flood-related impact and prior losses from previous hurricanes in the South Louisiana region.  The research will further consider how adults across the lifespan may show different effects of such disaster-related stress on cognitive functioning. With respect to broader societal impacts, the proposed research will yield critical new evidence to inform understanding of the time course of cognitive vulnerability and recovery after single and multiple disaster exposures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Catastrophic disasters have long-term consequences for survivors that are poorly understood.  Virtually no prior studies have examined adult cognition in the wake of natural disaster, possibly due to the great difficulty in carrying out basic research in disaster-impacted communities where severe weather events have damaged neighborhoods and crippled local infrastructure.  In August of 2016, historic flooding in Baton Rouge, Louisiana resulted in 13 deaths with damages estimated in billions of dollars.  Given the likelihood of future severe weather events in disaster-prone areas, it becomes increasingly important to understand how disaster exposure and devastating personal losses may impact cognition in the months and years following a natural disaster.   The present research examined relationships among individual and cumulative disaster stressors and cognitive performance.  Three domains of cognition were central to this investigation due to their presumed sensitivity to disaster stressors and relevance to daily life:  (1) working memory (WM) and sustained attention;  (2) long-term memory (LTM), and (3) general fluid intelligence (Gf).  Participants were sampled from a three parish (county) area of the Baton Rouge metropolitan region that was most severely devastated by the 2016 flooding.  Three groups were compared:  (1) non-flooded adults who were indirectly exposed to the 2016 flood, (2) once flooded adults with structural damage to homes and property due to the 2016 flooding, and 3) twice flooded adults who had previously relocated to Baton Rouge because of catastrophic losses in the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and flooded again in 2016.  Participants completed paper and pencil questionnaires that assessed flood impact (including property damage, disaster stressors, and disruption), and subjective cognitive complaints.  They also completed approximately two hours of computer-based cognitive testing.  Over two hundred adults participated in Wave 1 testing during the immediate impact period.  Wave 2 testing was carried out during the post-disaster recovery phase approximately 9 months (plus or minus 3 months) after participants? first assessment.  Analyses confirmed that the working memory measures were intercorrelated as expected and the size of the correlations was similar to what is typically observed with non-disaster exposed adults.  Additionally, working memory was also strongly correlated with general fluid intelligence, yielding critical new evidence concerning the central role WM plays in Gf.  Contrary to expectation, we found very little evidence of disaster exposure group differences across the three domains of cognition, indicating that the non-flooded, once flooded, and twice flooded adults performed comparably on these objective measures of cognition.  Self-reported disaster stressors were also unrelated to cognitive performance at Wave 1 testing.  Taken together, these findings imply that single and multiple exposures to disaster do not appear to increase cognitive vulnerability or disrupt cognitive performance assessed with traditional, laboratory-based measures.   Importantly, the pattern of outcomes obtained for the paper and pencil measures of functional impairment in everyday life confirmed the hypothesis that recent and cumulative disaster exposures negatively impact self-reported cognitive impairment.  Planned analyses for the Wave 2 follow-up will indicate whether participants? self-perceived deficits in cognition persist or improve over time.   In closing, the present research utilized a novel design to investigate natural changes in objective cognitive performance and self-reported functional impairment after a catastrophic disaster among survivors with a wide range of ages.  Our first findings shed new light on the cognitive consequences of disaster-related stressors in the aftermath of a natural disaster.  These data imply that disaster-related stressors may have a greater impact on survivors? self-reported cognitive capabilities than their objective performance using traditional, laboratory based measures of adult cognition.  Discrepancies between one?s self-reported perception of their own memory or cognition and their objective performance are common in other literature (e.g., studies of aging, studies of patient or clinical groups) and we extend these findings to disaster related-stressors.  Future research to examine the generality of these findings seems warranted.           Last Modified: 02/26/2019       Submitted by: Katie E Cherry]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
