<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Oregon (UO), in Eugene, OR, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020. Student interns are trained in scientific research methodologies, presentation, critical thinking, and experimental design. The scientific focus of the program (UO REU) is in molecular biosciences. UO REU provides closely mentored cutting edge research projects in a rich active learning environment for interns. Research areas include molecular biology, biochemistry, structural biology &amp; biophysics, bioinformatics, molecular neurobiology, molecular evolution, microbiology, developmental biology, genomics, molecular genetics, cell biology, and computational biology. The Program features training in professional and responsible conduct of research, graduate school counseling, training in oral and written scientific communication, accessing, processing, and evaluating scientific literature, and informal and formal presentation of research outcomes. Weekly research group discussions, professional development workshops, faculty seminars, and oral and written progress reports provide rigorous preparation for graduate school and careers in research. Professional and social interactions with active researchers at all levels are offered. Recruiting and selection strategies focus on students having limited access to research opportunities, students from groups underrepresented in STEM, disadvantaged students, and those with disabilities. The selection process involves all participating faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and all interns are expected to attend and present findings at national professional conferences. The program aims to enhance the diversity and talent of the next generation of life scientists in the research community and train role models for future generations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to assess the effectiveness of the training program, and UO REU specific focus groups and assessment will be used as well. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://uoreu.uoregon.edu or by email (uoreu@uoregon.edu) addessed to the PI, Dr. Peter O'Day, or co-PI, Dr. Bryan Rebar.</AbstractNarration>
