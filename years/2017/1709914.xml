<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permanent magnets are key components in a diverse range of technologies, most notably&lt;br/&gt;in electric motors and electric generators. They are also critical to magnetic recording,&lt;br/&gt;which still forms the foundation of large-scale data storage devices. To improve the&lt;br/&gt;performance of magnets, new materials, new strategies, and new science are needed. One&lt;br/&gt;approach towards improving magnetic behavior is called exchange coupling, in which&lt;br/&gt;two different magnetic materials interact at the quantum level to create new properties&lt;br/&gt;not available from either material by itself. For this to be effective, however, requires that&lt;br/&gt;the materials be intertwined at the nanoscale, called a nanocomposite material. Most&lt;br/&gt;research on nanocomposite materials has explored two extremes. Extreme simplicity is&lt;br/&gt;provided by thin films, in which the two materials are simply thin, planar layers on top of&lt;br/&gt;one another. Extreme complexity is provided by bulk nanocomposites, where tiny grains&lt;br/&gt;with irregular shapes, sizes and interfaces, are mutually intertwined. This project&lt;br/&gt;investigates a very special nanocomposite, called the nanochessboard, where a regular&lt;br/&gt;tiling of the two materials is achieved by self-assembly, in specific combinations of&lt;br/&gt;materials, simply by heating them. The resulting structure looks much like a chessboard,&lt;br/&gt;but where the individual tiles are nano-sized. The Intellectual Merit of this study&lt;br/&gt;emphasizes varying the materials combinations in order to illuminate how the nature of&lt;br/&gt;the materials affects both their self-assembly into nanochessboards, and their ability to&lt;br/&gt;exchange couple. In turn, this will provide the Broader Impacts of the study - the&lt;br/&gt;important new understanding of the behaviors that can be used to define new strategies&lt;br/&gt;for creating high-performance exchange-coupled magnets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will select and compete lengthscales, structural vs. magnetic, using advanced&lt;br/&gt;processing techniques to create refined nanochessboards in the Fe-Pd and Fe-Pt systems,&lt;br/&gt;in order to better understand, control, and enhance exchange-coupled ferromagnetism.&lt;br/&gt;These binary systems contain eutectoids of the form A1-- L10+L12 that result in&lt;br/&gt;chessboards by pseudo-spinodal decomposition, if processing conditions are carefully&lt;br/&gt;controlled. The Intellectual Merit is framed by the specific choice of alloys to be used&lt;br/&gt;here, which dictates the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy associated with the L10&lt;br/&gt;phase, which, in turn, selects the critical lengthscale for exchange coupling. Chessboards&lt;br/&gt;are produced by cooling continuously through the eutectoid, but to gain additional control&lt;br/&gt;over the periodicity, thermomechanical processing and cyclic annealing will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated. The degree of exchange coupling will be interrogated using First Order&lt;br/&gt;Reversal Curve analysis, which excels at revealing how magnetic phases interact. In&lt;br/&gt;addition to the growth of chessboards from an initially polycrystalline A1 starting&lt;br/&gt;material, monocrystalline A1 will also be grown, and then annealed under magnetic fields&lt;br/&gt;or biaxial strain, to create a single-alignment-variant chessboard. This will enable better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the magnetization reversal mechanisms, as well as the chessboard&lt;br/&gt;transformation itself. Real-time x-ray diffraction will be employed during chessboard&lt;br/&gt;formation to better elucidate the kinetics and progression of the transformation. The&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of success in the proposed research would be the contribution to our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of exchange-coupled ferromagnetism in bulk nanocomposite magnets, not&lt;br/&gt;only including hierarchical lengthscales, but the role of phase morphology, interfaces and&lt;br/&gt;strain. Improving permanent magnets is of ongoing major significance with regard to&lt;br/&gt;increasing the efficiency of electric motors.</AbstractNarration>
