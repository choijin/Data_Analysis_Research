<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational and theoretical research aimed to contribute to the discovery of new materials for all solid-state batteries. In contrast to all solid-state batteries, conventional lithium-ion batteries suffer from fire hazards and low energy-density. Solid-state batteries will be safer and enable advances in electric vehicle and renewable energy technologies, but they are not yet commercially viable because most solids do not conduct ions as well as the liquids or polymer gels used in conventional batteries. Batteries require a separator that conducts ions, but not electrons, called an electrolyte. Advances in the fundamental understanding of ion conductivity in solids are needed to predict materials with very fast ion conductivity, superionic electrolytes. Battery technology will be transformed by the discovery of crystalline and amorphous superionic electrolytes, which are cheaper to manufacture and can improve battery stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use large-scale simulations of ion conductivity in known solid electrolytes to advance fundamental knowledge of the relationship between a material's structure and composition and conductivity. The tools developed to identify these relationships will be used to screen for new materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master's and undergraduate students will receive training in this project at San Francisco State University, one of the most diverse institutions in the nation. The PI incorporates her research into computational and physical chemistry courses to recruit students. Active participation of students in frontier research will enrich their education and prepare them, many from under-represented groups, for professional careers in the sciences. The research team volunteers with Girls-Who-Code, a pioneering organization that introduces high school students to computer science, kindling their interest and building confidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award supports computational research using large-scale ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations to advance fundamental knowledge of the effect of bonding and structural disorder on ionic conductivity. The project goal is to predict ionic conductivity in solid materials and use high-throughput screening to discover new superionic electrolytes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research tests the hypothesis that the breaking and forming of bonds to lithium, bonding dynamics, significantly affects lithium conductivity, especially through correlated motion. Most previous theories of lithium conductivity in electrolytes assume that lithium retains a constant ionic bond character and motion is uncorrelated. Identification of the lithium-anion bond character as ionic or polar-covalent is a novel approach of this research. The research team will compare correlated motion and bonding dynamics among many known fast lithium conductors, leading to the development of generalized analysis tools for predicting higher conductivity electrolytes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Most previous attempts to predict new solid electrolytes have focused on crystalline materials. The research team aims to identify the effect of disorder on lithium conductivity in amorphous electrolytes, using both empirical and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations to compare crystalline and amorphous electrolytes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will include master's and undergraduate students in all aspects of this computational project: performing the molecular dynamics, writing scripts to analyze data, and constructing comparative simulations to gain insight into conductivity. The PI incorporates coding, simulation, and electrochemistry into her courses, to inspire and recruit students into research and into science careers. The research team will volunteer to introduce local high school students to this research and computational science.</AbstractNarration>
