<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education in exploring and realizing exotic quantum phenomena in engineered solid-state devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synthesizing controllable phases of matter in the laboratory is essential for advancing both fundamental science and quantum technologies.  As a prominent recent example, certain phases have been predicted to support exotic particles that are expected to display uniquely quantum behaviors; this new physics can, in turn, be exploited to create quantum computers that wildly outperform modern machines for certain tasks. One powerful route forward towards realization in the laboratory combines well-understood systems to force electrons into novel states of matter that might otherwise be difficult to realize. The PI's research will pursue this line of attack to explore a variety of engineered systems, with applications ranging from quantum computing to tabletop simulations of black-hole physics and quantum chaos. The results will help in bridging novel theories with tangible experiments, while also streamlining the realization of new technologies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be complemented by a multifaceted education and outreach program.  Training of undergraduates and graduate students in modern theoretical research topics will comprise a major component.  Research advances will be broadly disseminated, to specialists and non-specialists alike, through research articles, seminars, commentaries, blog posts, special summer schools, and courses.  In order to promote interest in science at an early age, the PI's group will also host elementary-, middle-, and high-school students visiting Caltech from nearby schools, which serve many economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and education in exploring and realizing exotic quantum phenomena in engineered solid-state devices.  The project will specifically investigate the following areas: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;i) Nanowire-based realizations of interacting Majorana-fermion models that exhibit profound connections to black holes, chaos, and holography.  Viewing the problem from this hardware perspective has the potential to reveal new insights that further link high energy, quantum information, and condensed matter physics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ii) Plausible avenues toward new non-Abelian phases in topological-insulator surfaces and quantum-Hall systems.  This research will begin to bridge the gulf between theory and experiment in these areas while also deepening connections between topological insulators and quantum-Hall systems that have recently come to light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;iii) Practical issues for existing and upcoming experiments pursuing topological quantum computing.  Research here includes simulating experimental protocols that probe fusion of non-Abelian anyons, and developing transport theories that will guide experiments towards realizing Majorana zero modes, parafermionic generalizations, and graphene-based topological insulators. These activities will support ongoing efforts at stabilizing non-Abelian anyons in engineered architectures and will help quantify their utility for quantum-information applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be complemented by a multifaceted education and outreach program.  Training of undergraduates and graduate students in modern theoretical research topics will comprise a major component.  Research advances will be broadly disseminated, to specialists and non-specialists alike, through research articles, seminars, commentaries, blog posts, special summer schools, and courses.  In order to promote interest in science at an early age, the PI's group will also host elementary-, middle-, and high-school students visiting Caltech from nearby schools, which serve many economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>
