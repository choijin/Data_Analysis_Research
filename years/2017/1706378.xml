<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1706378&lt;br/&gt;PI: Zasadzinski, Joseph A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The behavior of emulsions, foams, and other multiphase systems, including biological materials, is strongly affected by surface-active molecules, such as phospholipids and surfactants, at interfaces.  For more than a century, the behavior of molecules at flat interfaces has been studied using a Langmuir trough.  However, most interfaces in multiphase systems are curved, which affects the distribution of the molecules on the interface and the properties of the interface.   This award will support the use of new tools to examine the morphology and dynamics of molecular monolayers on bubbles with radii from 30 to 500 microns.  A confocal microscope will be used to determine how the chemical composition of the monolayer and molecular arrangements in the monolayer are affected by the curved surface of the bubble.  Atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements will help reveal how molecular packing is affected by curvature.  Variations in surface tension will be measured for a bubble whose size is changed at different rates.  Results from this research will help explain how effects of interfacial curvature on monolayers influence the stability of curved liquid surfaces in the lung, which is especially important in lung inflammation resulting from disease or trauma.  Results will also be useful in understanding the stability and rheology of commercially important emulsions and foams and the dynamics of tear films in the eye and wetting behavior of contact lenses. The project will engage students at all academic levels, as well as local high-school students and teachers.  Instructional modules containing images from the research will be prepared to illustrate the importance of material properties on lung health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monolayers of phospholipids, cholesterol, and fatty acids or alcohols can form coexisting, ordered, solid-like domains in a continuous, disordered, liquid-like matrix, or two immiscible liquid-like phases. On the flat interface of a Langmuir trough, the solid domains resist coalescence due to a long-range electrostatic dipole-dipole repulsion even though a measurable line tension acts to minimize the domain perimeter. Recent results suggest that for bubbles smaller than 200 µm, the connectivity of the solid phase domains changes to a mesh-like network with the fluid phase domains disconnected and isolated from each other.  This change in morphology and connectivity of the solid phase alters the dynamic dilatational modulus, which describes how the surface tension changes with interfacial area. Very little is known about experimental values of the dilatational modulus of mixed phospholipid, protein, fatty acid and cholesterol monolayers. Confocal microscopy will be used to image highly curved bubble surfaces to determine how interfacial curvature and monolayer composition alter the domain morphology, and a new capillary pressure microtensiometer will be used to measure how this morphology influences the dynamic dilatational modulus.  Lateral phase separation in monolayers is typical for clinical and native lung surfactants. The Laplace pressure suggests that interconnected bubbles or alveoli of different radii are, at best, metastable if the surface tension is constant. However, if the dilatational modulus is sufficiently large, resistance to interfacial compression can overcome the Laplace pressure and stabilize interconnected alveoli. Hence, the dilatational modulus, and how it depends on monolayer composition, morphology, interfacial curvature and changes in interfacial area are essential to lung stability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     In healthy lungs, expanding the thoracic cavity via the diaphragm lowers the pressure in the lung pleural sac (Pout) relative to ambient, Pam: (Pam - Pout) by ~ 1000- 1300 Pa. However, surface tension causes the pressure inside the alveolus, Pin, to increase according to Laplace’s equation: (Pin &ndash; Pout) = 2&gamma;/R ~ 1500 Pa for the air-saline surface tension,&gamma; = 72 mN/m, and the typical alveolar radius, R ~ 100 &micro;m. For air to flow, (Pam &ndash; Pin) &gt; 0; but the capillary pressure generated by the air-water surface tension yields a negative pressure difference and air no longer flows to the lungs.   In most air-breathing animals, lung surfactant (LS), a mixture of phospholipids and specific proteins, is generated within the cells lining the alveoli to lower the surface tension to make (Pam &ndash; Pin) &gt; 0.         A less appreciated role of lung surfactant may be to insure uniform lung inflation by eliminating the "Laplace Instability" .  The Laplace pressure difference between the inside and outside of the bubble, &Delta;P = 2&gamma;/R, is inversely proportional to the bubble radius; interconnected bubbles of radius R are at best metastable for a constant surface tension, &gamma;. Smaller bubbles have higher internal pressure than larger bubbles, forcing air to flow to larger, lower pressure bubbles, which causes the pressure inside the small bubbles to increase, further deflating the small bubbles; this dynamic process is known as the "Laplace Instability" . It is not understood how this Laplace instability translates into the thousands of interconnected alveoli of the lung, which have a significant variation in curvature due to different states of inflation and different inherent sizes.  However, if lung surfactants maintained a constant surface tension, smaller alveoli could deflate, while larger alveoli could distend.  In the extreme, following deflation, the smallest alveoli could fill with liquid and would be difficult to re-inflate, which is a typical symptom of the lung instabilities in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome or ARDS.  Normal lung surfactant causes the surface tension to decrease sufficiently with decreasing interfacial area that the Laplace instability is avoided.  However, lipases from the immune system present during infections can break down phospholipids into lysolipid and fatty acids.  The lysolipids are orders of magnitude more soluble than the double tailed lipids in lung surfactant.  The lysolipid  concentration from all lipase activity during inflammation can compete for the interface even in the presence of a lung surfactant coated interface. The surface activity and diffusivity of lysolipids are such that lysolipid concentrations &gt; 0.1 mM can cause the Laplace instability due to the fast exchange of lysolipid at the interface with the epithelial fluids,  over the range of normal breathing frequencies.        This rapid exchange  is likely due to the reservoir of lysolipid micelles in the proximity of the interface, keeping the oncentration high and constant, greatly reducing the characteristic length scale for diffusive exchange between the monolayer and the subphase.  Below the CMC, a LysoPC depletion layer may arise near the interface as the monomer surfactant is adsorbed at the interface, greatly increasing    .   Increasing      by increasing the LysoPC concentration moves the crossover frequency at which     into the range of normal breathing frequencies.  From our model, we expect any soluble surface-active molecule at concentrations well above its CMC will decrease the dilatational modulus such that    , which, in turn will induce the Laplace Instability.        This suggests that lysolipids may play a previously unsuspected role in the lung instabilities in ARDS.  Increasing the lysolipid concentration in the epithelial lining fluids due to lipase activity throughout the lung moves the crossover  for the Laplace Instability into the range of normal breathing frequencies, which could lead to non-uniform lung inflation and alveolar collapse.  We find the necessary lysolipid concentration for inducing the Laplace Instability is ~ 20 times the critical micelle concentration of lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (CMC = 6 &micro;M).  We speculate that other lysolipids with smaller CMC values, such as lysosteroylphosphatidylcholine (CMC = 0.4 &micro;M) might induce the same effects at lower concentrations.  As the chain and head group chemistry that results from PLA2 degradation in the alveolar fluids is likely quite variable as bacteria, lung cells, and lung surfactant are hydrolysed, the lysolipid concentrations needed to induce the Laplace Instability might also be quite varied.  We also do not yet know the effects of lysolipid mixtures or phospholipid-lysolipid mixtures on the dilatational modulus.  Extending our work to more complex lung surfactant-lysolipid and serum protein mixtures should give us a better idea of the importance of the dilatational modulus and the Laplace Instability in the ARDS lung.
