<AbstractNarration>This project extends the University of Central Florida's (UCF) I-Corps Site for an additional three years beyond their initial three-year award. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the I-Corps Site renewal project at UCF include the capture and curation of a deep understanding of (1) the processes, methodologies and programs for entrepreneurship education and technology commercialization, (2) Best practices for transitioning research from the bench top into the marketplace, (3) and distributing this knowledge to collaborators, partners, and affiliates throughout the NIN, and (4) development and adaptation of programs for specialty cohorts supporting local clusters and targeted populations. Additional knowledge and understanding will be gained through the collection of longitudinal data following I-Corps participants after they have completed the curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCF is an active and engaged partner in the Central Florida innovation ecosystem. The broader impacts from this project directly contribute to the broader community understanding of innovation-based economic development and the importance of research and commercialization. This is critically important to a community that is dependent on tourism and hospitality and the associated lower paying jobs in the region. Building on the initial successes of the UCF I-Corps Site program, successful commercialization of research and inventions generated at the leading research institutions and affiliate organizations in the region, this renewal project has the potential to significantly impact the regional economy. Further, with curriculum that effectively serves Hispanic populations, there is the potential to produce major social and economic impact on a national level. Florida has the third largest Hispanic population in the U.S., with nearly 25% of UCF student population and 34% of Florida business owners being of Hispanic origin, making this an ideal location to develop, deploy, and refine the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
