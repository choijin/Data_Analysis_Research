<AbstractNarration>This project will review and synthesize existing literature on factors that impact the interest, participation, retention and success of women of color in computing and technology fields.  This type of project informs areas for future research and helps to identify promising practices that others can implement.  The project will result in a report to help inform those who are practitioners in STEM education, STEM employers, and STEM policy makers.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a mixed-methods meta-synthesis that will analyze and integrate the findings from empirical research on the factors that affect the retention of women of color in technology and computing higher education and careers. Focusing on literature produced since 2000, this synthesis will address the main research question: According to the existing empirical literature, what factors affect the experiences, participation, and advancement of women of color in technology and computing from the stages of early college education through their careers?  The goals of the project are to: (1) build new knowledge and understanding of the factors affecting the retention of women of color in technology and computing; (2) identify gaps in research; (3) inform leaders in the field about promising policies and practices that retain women of color in technology and computing; and (4) make methodological contributions through the testing and refinement of meta-synthesis tools and processes.  This project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
