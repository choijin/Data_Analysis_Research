<AbstractNarration>Part I&lt;br/&gt;SUNY Oneonta?s GP-EXTRA: Authentic Research Experiences for Earth Science Education Majors program strengthens the preparation of high school geoscience teachers with the broader goals of generating greater student enthusiasm for the geosciences, making students more likely to choose to major in the geosciences, and addressing the national workforce deficit of geoscientists. The project?s emphasis on model-based learning (MBL) provides pre-service Earth Science Education (ESE) majors with authentic research experiences designed to enrich content expertise and provide new avenues for improving student learning in high school geoscience classrooms. The insights gained through all aspects of the project will benefit geoscience educators specifically and science education professionals more broadly. Presentations and workshops at science teacher conferences will further broaden the project?s impact by exposing a large group of K-12 teachers to the benefits of using models of Earth processes created through the project. Pre-service participants who conduct these presentations will experience greater self-efficacy and begin to view themselves as both scientists and teachers of science. Publication of results in geoscience education and science education journals will inform science educators and teacher education programs about the benefits to student learning that accrue from use of new models created by our pre-service participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II&lt;br/&gt;The project engages pre-service ESE majors in authentic research experiences and immersion in MBL, a pedagogy proven to enhance students? conceptual understanding. For each year of the three-year project, a cohort of pre-service Earth Science teachers will design and build new models of Earth processes and concepts. Models are especially effective in Earth Science because so many geoscience processes and concepts operate on spatial and temporal scales that are difficult for students to grasp. Models developed by participants will be evaluated by New York State Master STEM Teachers and pilot-tested in K-12 and introductory geoscience college classes. Models will also be presented in ?Science Saturdays,? in informal science education venues, and at science teacher conferences. Through the design and construction of new models to help K-12 students conceptualize various Earth concepts, ESE majors will gain valuable insights into the nature of science and engineering design, which are important threads in the Next Generation Science Standards. These experiences will enable participating ESE majors to stimulate interest in the geosciences in K-12 students, with the ultimate goals of inspiring students to choose geoscience majors in college, and eventually reducing the deficit of geoscientists in the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
