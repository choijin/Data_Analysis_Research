<AbstractNarration>Although lithium ion batteries have been commercialized for consumer electronics, they still fall far behind the requirements needed for batteries used in long-range electric vehicles and large-scale renewable energy storage. There is a need to improve the energy densities of lithium ion batteries and to research "beyond lithium ion" battery technologies that employ high-capacity but low-cost materials such as silicon, oxygen or sulfur electrodes. Almost all battery chemistries in electrochemical energy storage cells operate beyond the stability limits of the electrolytes, substance that produce an electrically conducting solution when dissolved. These battery cells operate in many cases because electrode material-electrolyte reactions result in the formation of a protective material layer on the electrode material, called a solid-electrolyte interface layer. The mechanical and chemical reactivity properties of this protective layer dictate the energy, power and the long-term cycling stability of the battery system; however, fundamental knowledge on the formation of this protective layer is lacking. This research project is investigating a new solid-electrolyte interface layer formation mechanism that will enable design solutions for many of the performance limitations of batteries. The research outcomes of this project are being integrated into energy-themed educational activities for students to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative research project between research groups at the University and Arkansas and the University of Michigan seeks a fundamentally new solid-electrolyte interface formation mechanism by using silicon/electrolyte interfaces as a model system. Intensive electrochemical characterizations are being conducted by testing silicon film electrodes in various concentrated electrolytes to understand the coordination environments of lithium cations in the bulk electrolytes and its implications on the solid-electrolyte interface layer compositions. In situ atomic force microscopy is being employed to probe the formation and evolution of solid-electrolyte interface layers on silicon surfaces in a cell. Theoretical simulations are being combined with material characterizations to advance the fundamental understanding of solid-electrolyte interface layers derived from concentrated electrolytes. The research project is designed to test a new theory to control the interfacial properties between electrodes and electrolyte, one that is broadly applicable to battery technologies and many other energy storage and conversion systems.</AbstractNarration>

A quantification method has been developed through this project to quickly evaluate the SEI properties derived from various electrolytes, providing an effective protocol for electrolyte comparison and selection. &nbsp;The knowledge garthered from this project was then further applied to understand the roles of SEI layer in solid state batteries.

It was revealed that a in-situ formed SEI-like interfacial layer between Li and solid state electrolyte played a critical role in alleviating the growth and propagation of dendritic Li through phase boundaries of solid electrolytes. &nbsp;Si nanoparticles was thereby used to fill the surface micro-pores of LLZO pellets and form "reversible" SEI by alloying/dealloying with Li during cycling, which effectively extended the stable cycling of solid cells. The reversible SEI layers formed by using Si nanoparticles sheded new light on the significance of rational modifications on the interfacial properties between solid electrolytes and Li on eliminating Li dendrite formation to accelerate the development of solid-state batteries. The fundamental understanding gained from this project covers both liquid and solid batteries and is widely applicable in various battery systems. The new insights deepend current understanding in SEI formaiton mechanism and provided a very different way to view the same interfacial reactions.
